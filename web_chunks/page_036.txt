Wave based Renewable Energy
AWARE demonstrates potential renewable energy resource available from ocean waves over Indian Ocean region. The product is based on observations of the recent altimeters Jason-2 (2008-2014) and SARAL/Altika (2013-2014). It is particularly helpful in identification of ocean hotspots for extraction of ocean wave energy, that can be the next generation, environment friendly energy resource.It provides two types of products: Inter-annual monthly product from Jason-2 and SARAL/ALTIKA, Monthly climatology of ocean wave energy.

Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
The significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed for both the altimeters are taken from
Jason-2 (
http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com
)
SARAL/ALTIKA (
http://www.mosdac.gov.in
)
Processing Steps
Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of " Genetic Algorithm " (Remya et al. 2011)
Wave period hence derived is validated using buoy observations from Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)
Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The wave power (P) is mathematically derived as
Where
P is Wave power per unit of wave-crest length (in Kilowatt/m)
R represents the satellite range
H
m0
is the significant wave height (in meters)
T is wave period (in seconds)
ρ is the density of water (in kilogram/cubic meter)
g is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters/square seconds)
Limitations
The products have gaps as they are based purely on track altimeters data.
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)

Abstract
The wave power is computed from the altimeters (Jason-2 and SARAL/AltiKa) for a period of 2008-2014 at a monthly basis for individual years. Climatology is also prepared in this regard for the Indian Ocean Region.
