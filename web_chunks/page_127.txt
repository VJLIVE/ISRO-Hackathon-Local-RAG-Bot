I am a registered user of MOSDAC. When I download L1 data I get the message "Your account is configured to download this data with latency of  3 days. Please select date accordingly." How should I download data?
There are two category of users in MOSDAC, NRT users and General users, NRT users have access to real time data. General users are provided access Level-2 and onwards data in NRT and Level-1 data with a latency of 3 days. This message implies that the data product requested by you can't be download in near real time. You can download 3 days old data or you can contact to MOSDAC admin if you want near real time data.
