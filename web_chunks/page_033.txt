Ocean Subsurface
Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the “interior + surface Quasigeostrophic” (isQG) method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .

Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
Reynold's Optimum Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) (
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst
)
SMAP sea surface salinity (SSS) (
https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/data/
).
AVISO sea surface height (SSH) (
https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data.html
).
ISAS-13 temperature/salinity profile (
https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/16058
).
Processing Steps
Climatological temperature, salinity (T/S) fields are calculated from ISAS-13 data. Also Brunt-Viasala frequency(N) is calculated.
Monthly Sea surface density anomaly(SSDA) is calculated from GHRSST, SMAP and ISAS-Climatology.
Monthly sea surface height anomaly(SSHA) is calculated using AVISO data.
Using interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) methodology, taking Barotropic and first Baroclinic modes, and taking SSHA and SSDA as boundary conditions, ocean interior density and velocity anomaly are reconstructed.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1.
Limitations
This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator.
Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.
isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.
We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.
This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.
The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc.
