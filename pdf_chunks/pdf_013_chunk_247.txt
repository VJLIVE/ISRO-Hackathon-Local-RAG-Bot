The gradual increase and decrease was observed throughout the year with the seasonal transition. Monthly ETo linearly increased throughout India from January to June and then decreased in monsoon during July and August. After that, gradual rise in September coincident to higher insolation due to with drawl of monsoon. The ETo again decreases in October and November but there is rise in western part of India during December due to increase in day length in last dekad of December. 17.7.1. Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting The sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‘Sobol’ method. It consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent samples of ‘N’ repetitions (rows) and ‘k’ input variables (columns), retrieved from existing data or randomly generated data from the probability distribution function
