distribution of the state variable based on observed data and system dynamics. The cornerstone of particle filter is Bayes’s theorem which reads 𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) = 𝑝𝑑(𝑑|𝜓)𝑝𝑚(𝜓) 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) (1) Where: 1. 𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) is the Posterior distribution, representing the true state of the system generated using model simulated chlorophyll (𝜓) given chlorophyll observations (𝑑) from OCM-3. 2. 𝑝𝑑(𝑑|𝜓) is the likelihood function, representing the probability of observing 𝑑 given the prior information about the state of the system, which is the model simulated chlorophyll. This term plays a crucial role in assigning weights to the model particles based on their consistency with the observed data. 3. 𝑝𝑚(𝜓) is the prior information about the ocean surface chlorophyll, also known as background fields. These are obtained from coupled model simulations of chlorophyll. A set of randomly selected model particles represent the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the background fields. The model PDF can be written as p(ψ) = 1 𝑁∑ 𝛿(𝜓−𝜓𝑖) 𝑁 𝑖=1 (2) where, N is the number of particles. 𝜓𝑖 is spanning the range from 1 to N. The term 𝛿(𝜓−𝜓𝑖) represents the PDF of an individual particle centered around its value 𝜓𝑖, where 𝛿 is the Dirac delta function. The number of particles in the study N is 250. 4. 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) is the probability of observations. Its computation can be challenging, particularly in scenarios with sparse observations. This probability is not directly computed but is implicitly represented by the sum of weights of particles (𝑤𝑖). These weights, assigned to each particle based on its likelihood of matching the observations, collectively form a probability distribution. Normalizing the weights ensures that they sum up to one, effectively representing the likelihood of observing 𝑑 across all particles. Thus, the 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) can be written as: 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) = ∑ 𝑤𝑖 𝑁 𝑖=1 (3) where 𝑤𝑖 is the
