vector wind is represented by a complex number j i j i c j i v i u V , , ,   . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image- pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height). Visible wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 206 Fig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process. Here X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector differences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as   t j i c t j i dif V V V , , , ,   . Here c V represents the current vector at (i, j) point and  t j i V , , neighborhood vectors with 1 1 , 1 1       j i and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences dif V , excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector differences   dif V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the average of 10 dif V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where
