is defined in terms of percentage of total number of simulated wind vectors bearing that particular rank are closest to the wind directions used in simulating the radar backscatter data through GMF. Algorithm implementation is verified by observing 100 percent skill of top ranked solutions for noise-free condition (K=0) also with even and odd intervals of trial direction for retrievals as well as for simulating backscatter data. For MLE algorithm a small GMF modeling error (1.0e-14) is used to avoid division by zero in MLCF calculations. For the swath location exactly at the sub- satellite track where azimuth separation is 180, the skill is 50% irrespective of the algorithm as pairing of solutions takes place with the same ranking. 22 The performances of MLE and NSD algorithms are evaluated for K=1.5 as depicted in figure (10a). The skill is evaluated separately for each wind vector cell (WVC) location numbered from 1 to 37 across the swath. The WVC numbered 19 corresponds to the sub-satellite track position. The algorithm skill for each WVC is evaluated using wind vector cases with wind speed varying from 1 to 25 m/s with 2 m/s interval and wind direction varying from 0° to 354° with 6° interval yielding total 780 data points. The backscatter data are perturbed with noise controlled by parameter K with GMF modeling error of 1.0e-14. It is also observed from figure (10a) for K=1.5 that MLE and NSD algorithms have almost equal performances. The retrieval errors in wind speed and direction of both the algorithms as shown are found to be almost comparable. Apart from this, comparison of distribution of directions retrieved using these algorithms is also performed as shown in figure (10b) and is also found to be mostly similar.
