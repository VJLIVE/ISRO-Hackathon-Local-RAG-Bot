measured every approximately 35 days. 1.4.1.3. Reference Ellipsoid The Reference Ellipsoid is the first-order definition of the non-spherical shape of the Earth as an ellipsoid of revolution with equatorial radius of 6378.1363 kilometers and a flattening coefficient of 1/298.257 (same reference ellipsoid as used by the Jason-1, SARAL/AltiKa and the T/P missions). 1.4.2. Correction Conventions All environmental and instrument corrections are computed so that they should be added to the quantity which they correct. That is, a correction is applied to a measured value by Corrected Quantity = Measured Value + Correction This means that a correction to the altimeter range for an effect that lengthens the apparent signal path (e.g., wet troposphere correction) is computed as a negative number. Adding this negative number to the uncorrected (measured) range reduces the range from its original value toward the correct value. Example: Corrected Range = Measured Range + Range Correction. 1.4.3. Time Convention Times are UTC and referenced to January 1, 2000 00:00:00.00. A UTC leap second can occur on June 30 or December 31 of any year. The leap second is a sixty-first second introduced in the last minute of the day. Thus the UTC values (minutes:seconds) appear as: 59:58 ; 59:59 ; 59:60 ; 00:00 ; 00:01. 1.4.4. Unit Convention All distances and distance corrections are reported in tenths of millimeters (10-1 mm). 1.4.5. Flagging and Editing In general, flagging consists of three parts: instrument flags (on/off), telemetry flags (preliminary flagging and editing) and data quality flags (geophysical processing flags). Instrument flags provide information about the state of the various instruments on the satellite. Telemetry flags are first based on instrument modes and checking of telemetry data quality. Only severely corrupted data are not processed (i.e. data that cannot be correctly read on ground). Flag setting is designed to
