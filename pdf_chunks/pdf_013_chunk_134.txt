converges for this pair, then retrieval is considered to be successful, otherwise the same procedure is repeated with pairs of (ch#3, ch#4) or (ch#4, ch#5). If none of these pairs are able to give value of cloud top pressure, then window channel method is used for retrieval of cloud top pressure. 10.6.2. Window Channel method for cloud top pressure for low to mid clouds In this method the cloud top pressure is carried out by comparing infrared window channel brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile (GFS; Derber et al. 1991). This method assumes that clouds are overcast and non-transmissive (=1). Generally, cloud top temperatures/pressure of low level overcast clouds are determined by using window channel method. In addition to it, wherein, cloud top pressure is not determined by CO2 slicing method, window channel method is used to retrieve cloud top properties for those pixels too. In this method cloud top pressure is determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of BT cloudy pixels in 5x5 FOR, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. The cloud emissivity is assumed to be unity and N=Nc/25. Finally, all cloudy FORs are assigned a cloud top pressure either by CO2 slicing or infrared window technique. 10.7. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure The value of cloud top height and cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are derived corresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder. These values are again derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the temperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates.
