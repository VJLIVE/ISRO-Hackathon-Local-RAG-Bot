cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present Snow cover INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 103 investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern, which can not be seen when area is cloud covered. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55- 3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has been successfully used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006). Reflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose. Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from snow is high in the
