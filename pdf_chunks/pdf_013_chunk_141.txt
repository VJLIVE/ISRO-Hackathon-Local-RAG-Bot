can be studied with the help of a radiative transfer (RT) model. A Radiative transfer model (RTM) computes the radiative transfer of the electromagnetic radiation through the atmosphere. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties is done with the help of an RT model using the imager channels of INSAT-3D. The INSAT-3D channels which may be used for cloud properties retrieval includes Visible (0.65µm) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR-1.66µm). The importance of retrieving the optical thickness and effective radius derives not only from the fact that such a retrieval is possible, but from the fact that shortwave cloud radiative properties depend almost exclusively on these two parameters. 11.4. Objective The main objective of this document is to provide step wise algorithm, inputs and outputs as expected from the INSAT-3D cloud microphysical product. This document will form the basis of operational implementation of the algorithm. 11.5. Inputs Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for Visible channel and SWIR along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). 11.5.1. Static data This will consist of the Look-up Table (LUT) which is generated using a RT model and stored. A random dataset of cloud microphysical parameters with solar geometry is also stored as static file. These files will be required by the inversion model. 11.5.2. Dynamic data The following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration: INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 123 Table 3: IMAGE AND CALIBRATION INPUTS Parameter Resolution Quantization Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of VIS channel (0.65) 4 Km (at present) 1 Km (Testing TBD) 10 bit Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of SWIR channel (1.66) 4 Km (at present) 1 Km (Testing TBD) 10 bit Gray value to albedo (VIS and SWIR)
