terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain slope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local illumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation incident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. Markham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for the Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating. To estimate reflectance from a rugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has to be used as given below: Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 122  =  L d2 / Esun cosi Where, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and i is the local illumination angle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by using the relation given by Robinson (1966). Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968; Dirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from snow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow will change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005). F(θi, Øi, θr, Ør) = dLr (θi, Øi, θr, Ør)/Li cos θi dwi Where, Θi = Zenith angle of incident ray Øi = Azimuth angle of incident ray Θr = Zenith angle of reflected ray Ør = Azimuth angle of reflected ray Li = Incident radiance dLr = Reflected radiance in solid angle dwi = Solid angle 7.4.1.1.5 SNOW FRACTION
