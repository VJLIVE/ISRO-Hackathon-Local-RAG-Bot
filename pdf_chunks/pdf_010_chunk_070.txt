the above steps of the development and validation of the algorithm. Remarks: Some of the steps like the cloud microphysics (cloud microphysics and their optical properties, etc.) are a grey area of research and needs experience and thus can be taken up only as R&D efforts. The hourly rainfall from rain gauges and DWRs and the IMD model forecasts from IMD in proper grid sizes (3-6 hourly, 0.5x0.5 deg. grid) are essential. In addition, the advanced approach suggested here to use satellite microwave information to augment thermal IR rainfall measurements along with VIS and WV would also require a large R & D effort (in terms of man hours). 4.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution QPE (GPI) Histogram of BT’s Daily, Pentad, Monthly & seasonal rainfall mm K mm 0 < 180 K 0 72 mm/ day > 280 K 72 mm/day TBD 24 Class TBD 1.0x1.0 and 0.5x0.5 deg 1.0 x 1.0 1.0 x 1.0 QPE (IMSRA) Histogram of BT’s Daily, Pentad, Monthly & Seasonal rainfall mm K mm 0 < 170 K 0 TBD > 300 K TBD TBD 24 Class TBD 1.0x1.0 and 0.5x0.5 deg -- do -- -- do -- 4.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Basic format would be to obtain QPE on a give domain with geolocation, and rainfall values. However, the QPE would be represented in various shades, contours and with desired color coding thereof. The 24 class histogram also will be generated. Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 61 Domain : For both GPI and IMSRA the domain for rainfall estimation mainly would be 500 S to 500 N, 300 E to 1300 E. 4.6 Validation Rainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods mentioned above. These are required to
