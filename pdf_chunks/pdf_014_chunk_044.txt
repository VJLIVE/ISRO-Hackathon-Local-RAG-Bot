two spectral bands of the INSAT-3D Imager instrument significantly underestimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values. This factor severely modulates the LSA computations. An exercise was carried out to compensate this factor of underestimation from a systematic comparison between TOA radiances of INSAT-3D Imager and INSAT-3A CCD and MODIS sensors. After introducing the radiance calibration coefficients equation (4) can be rewritten as, Where 1 and 2 are radiance calibration coefficients of INSAT-3D Imager instrument. Assuming the multiplication of two coefficients 1 and C1 as new coefficient 1, 2 and C2 as 2 and C0 as 0, equation (5) can be rewritten as, 3.4.4. Data used and generation of LSA Raw digital number data of visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor corresponding to 10:30 hrs of 1st of each month of year 2015 was downloaded from the MOSDAC server. The digital number data were converted to the TOA radiances, which was subsequently converted to INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 41 the TOA reflectances using equation (1). A cloud mask was devised from two sources, (a) thresholds of INSAT-3D Imager data and (b) MODIS cloud mask. A cloud-free TOA reflectance data was then converted to the LSA using the N to B coefficients generated from the simulation exercise as discussed in previous section. A land over product available from the MODIS sensor was used as a reference for applying land cover-based N to B coefficients. 3.5. Results Monthly broadband LSA maps were derived from the INSAT-3D Imager data representing 1st day of each month of the year 2015 using the method discussed in the above section. The broadband LSA was derived at a spatial resolution of 4 km over India and surrounding region. The broadband LSA maps for different months are shown in the figure 3. Visually the spatial patterns
