DORIS System The complete DORIS system includes the DORIS on board package, a network of approximately 60 beacons located around the world and a ground system. The on board package includes the electronic box hosting the receiver itself and the ultra stable oscillator and an omnidirectional antenna. The DORIS on board package is of the same version than the one embarked on SARAL/ALTIKA. It includes a 7-beacon receiving capability and an on-board real time function (DIODE for « Détermination Immédiate d’Orbite par DORIS Embarqué ») to compute the orbit ephemeris in real time. The DORIS on board package is dual string (in cold redundancy), each DORIS chain is automatically connected to the single antenna through a switching box inside the DORIS unit . Each receiver is connected to its own ultra-stable oscillator. The DORIS antenna is located on the Earth panel of the satellite. Figure 6 : SARAL/AltiKa DORIS Receiver Antenna and Instrument 2.6.2.4. Laser Reflector Array (LRA) It is used for precise calibration of other POD instruments, through analysis of laser shots from the ground then reflected by the LRA mirrors. The laser reflector array is placed on the nadir face of the satellite. It consists of several quartz corner cubes arrayed as a truncated cone with one in the center and the others distributed azimuthally around the cone. The LRA is provided by CNES.
