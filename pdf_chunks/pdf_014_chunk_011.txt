1995). INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 15 1.2.2. Remote Sensing of Snow Cover One of the earliest methods used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2004). This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). Another major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern, which cannot be seen when area is cloud covered. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore, discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55- 1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and
