state variable C. 2.3.2.3 Coupled biogeochemical - physical model (MOM5-TOPAZ) The coupled biogeochemical - physical model is configured for global ocean with a horizontal resolution of 25 km and a variable vertical resolution with a very fine near surface and coarser towards the bottom of ocean. There are 50 levels in the vertical direction. The external time step used is 22.5 sec and the internal time step used is 1800 sec. The model bottom topography is derived from the 2 minute resolution ETOPO 2 database. The surface salt is restored to climatology on a time scale of 2 months. During spin up, the physical model was forced by climatological wind and flux data sets and was initialized with temperature and salinity data from Levitus. The model was spun up for 50 years from rest. Afterwards, TOPAZ model is coupled with the physical model and performed a climatology run for another 10 years. For this nitrate, phosphate and silicate are initialised using data from WOA13. After this, an inter-annual run is performed using the daily forcing fields of wind, net short and long wave radiation, precipitation, air temperature and specific humidity from NCMRWF from 2018 onwards. Model forecast is also performed using the NCMRWF data sets for the next 8 days. Model forecasts are written for every six hours, while the analysis fields are written daily. 2.3.3 Other Auxiliary data: None Table 1: Input data sets for the algorithm Data sets Spatial Resolution Temporal Resolution Chlorophyll from coupled model 25 km x 25 km Daily Chlorophyll from OCM-3 (GAC product) 1 km Daily 3.
