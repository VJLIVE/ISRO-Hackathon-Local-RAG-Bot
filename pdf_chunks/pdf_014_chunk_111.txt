is assumed to be fail. If one FOV passes all the tests then that FOV is upgraded to clear. If FOV fails any of the tests then it is flagged as cloudy or partially cloudy depending on the SAF flag. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 96 8.3.2. Clear-Sky Brightness Temperature computation The CSBT product at for pixel is computed as average of the clear-sky pixel brightness temperatures in the 3x3 FOR centered at the pixel location, if at least 3 clear pixels are found in the FOR. The averaging reduces the impact due to the uncertainty in cloud-detection algorithm as well as reduces the random noise of measurements (NEÔÅÑT) over individual pixels. The land/sea flag as well as the clear fraction in the FOR is also computed.

Validation Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR Sounder will be carried out using various analyses, such as NCMRWF, GFS, ECMWF analysis etc. These analyses will be used to generate brightness temperatures using PFAAST/RTTOV/CRTM radiative transfer models. The validation cannot be carried out for each half-hourly product but validation will be carried out for only synoptic hours. For validation at specific time-period special launch campaign will be carried out where high quality radiosondes are launched and these soundings would be used with radiative transfer model for CSBT validation. Apart from this inter-satellite comparison will be carried out using CSBT products from hyperspectral
