USA and Canadian Prairies were analyzed. During matching observations, to reduce the effect of possible inhomogeneity of the snow depth distribution and inaccuracy of gecoding, snow fraction was averaged 3 x 3 grid. For development of this technique, forested region was exclude. A statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). D = eaF â€“1 Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 123 Where, D (cm) is the snow depth, F (%) is the snow fraction and a is a parameter. The best approximation of snow fraction and snow depth was achieve with a = 0.0333. This means 100 percent snow fraction can give snow depth around 27 cm. This could be major limitation in the Himalaya, as snow depth is normally very high due orographic effect and avalanche accumulation of snow. In order to apply this concept in the Himalaya, daily snow depth data needs to be collected from IMD and SASE observatories and region specific relationship needs to be developed. This relationship should be developed using historical INSAT, MODIS and snow depth data. Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 124 7.4.1.2 Flow Chart Figure 1.
