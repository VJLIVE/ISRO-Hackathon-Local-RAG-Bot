UTC for 3DR; following day). It is expected that near-real-time hourly emissions from BBEP would provide a crucial component for atmospheric and chemical transport modelers to forecast air quality and weather conditions. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 27 2.3. Algorithm Overview Biomass burning emissions can be modeled using four fundamental parameters; burned area, fuel loading (biomass density), the fraction of biomass combustion, and the factors of emissions for trace gases and aerosols. By integrating these parameters, biomass burning emissions can be estimated using the following formula (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980): E = DM * F = A * B * C * F ………………….(1) Where, E = emissions from biomass burning (kg); DM = dry fuel mass combusted (kg); F = factor of consumed biomass that is released as trace gases and smoke particulates A = burned area (km2); B = biomass density (kg/km2); C = fraction of biomass consumed during a fire event. This simple model has been widely applied to estimate fire emissions in local, regional, and global scales (Ito and Penner, 2004; Reid et al., 2004; Wiedinmyer et al., 2006; van der Werf et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). The accuracy of the emissions depends strongly on the quality of fuel loading and burned area estimates, which have high uncertainties (Zhang et al., 2008; van der Werf et al., 2010; French et al., 2011). Alternatively, Wooster, 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship between fuel consumption and total emitted fire radiative energy. This is due to the fact that the total amount of energy released per unit mass of dry fuel fully burned is weakly dependent on vegetation types and fuel types, which ranges between 16 and 22 MJ/kg (Lobert and Warnatz, 1993; Whelan, 1995; Trollope et al., 1996; Wooster et al., 2005). Thus, biomass burning emission
