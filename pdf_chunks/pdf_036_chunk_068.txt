NetCDF data sets. WARNING Default values are given to data when computed values are not available (See section 6.1.2.4) so you must screen parameters to avoid using those with default values. Also you must check flag values. The related flags are given in the description of each variable (See section 6.1.2.4) although some discussion of flags appears in this section. 4.2.1. Corrected Altimeter Range The main data of the (O)(I)GDR are the altimeter ranges. The (O)(I)GDR provides ranges measured at Ka band. The given range is corrected for instrumental effects (net_instr_corr_range_ka). The given range must be corrected for path delay in the atmosphere through which the radar pulse passes and the nature of the reflecting sea surface. All range corrections are defined and they should be ADDED to the range. The corrected (Ka band) range is given by : Corrected Range = Range + Wet Troposphere Correction + Dry Troposphere Correction + Ionosphere Correction + Sea State Bias Correction Wet Troposphere Correction : SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 48 Use radiometer correction (rad_wet_tropo_corr). Dry Troposphere Correction : Use model correction (model_dry_tropo_corr). Ionosphere Correction : Use model ionosphere correction (iono_corr_gim). Sea State Bias Correction : Use sea state bias correction (sea_state_bias). 4.2.2. Sea Surface Height and Sea Level Anomaly Sea surface height (SSH) is the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. It is calculated by subtracting the corrected range from the Altitude: Sea Surface Height = Altitude - Corrected Range The sea level anomaly (SLA), also referred to as Residual Sea Surface, is defined here as the sea surface height minus the mean sea surface and minus known geophysical effects, namely tidal and inverse barometer. It is given by: Sea Level Anomaly = Sea Surface Height - Mean Sea Surface - Solid
