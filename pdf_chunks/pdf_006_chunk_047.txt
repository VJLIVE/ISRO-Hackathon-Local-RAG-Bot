the description of the scientific algorithms which will be developed and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of NOAA from the data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard INSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6μm, NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm, IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. 4.2.2 Objectives There are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These techniques are popularly known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and GOES Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm Technique (GMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at estimation of rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal requirements respectively. First GPI related objectives are the implementation of the algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the second one is related to the development of the algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber (2001). Originally the GPI technique has been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by Global community for more than two decades. The GMSRA on the other hand is a new one and is developed and used only by USA based on integrated efforts from many group of researchers along with the supporting Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 47 infrastructure (like ground truths with high spatial and temporal coverage’s etc.). from a hundred of radars on the ground. The inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors
