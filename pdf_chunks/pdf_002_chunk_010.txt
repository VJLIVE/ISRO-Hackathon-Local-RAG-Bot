of the SAPHIR. We examine the probability distribution (PDF) of brightness temperatures measured at all 6 channels of SAPHIR for rainy and non-rainy conditions for all scan locations. Figure 1 (a) to (f) show plots of PDFs of SAPHIR brightness temperatures for channel S1 and S6 for a typical scan position # 45 for rainy and non- rainy conditions over the oceans. There do exist similar PDFs for other pixel locations over the oceans and land. The PDF of the brightness temperatures for rainy cases is shown as line joining open circles and that for non-rainy cases is shown as line joining solid circles. It may be observed that there is large overlap of PDFs of brightness temperatures from all the channels for rainy and non-rainy cases, and thus making it difficult to identify a threshold value of brightness temperature for clearly demarcating rainy and non-rainy conditions. Despite of having large overlap area between PDFs of rainy and non-rainy cases, the Fig. 1 shows clear and distinct peaks of PDFs for two cases in all the 6 channels of SAPHIR, which suggest some tangible sensitivity of the brightness temperatures to rain. Figure 1 shows PDFs of brightness temperatures for a typical scan position over the oceans, there, however, exists similar qualitative behavior of PDFs of brightness temperatures for rainy and non-rainy cases at other scan positions over land and oceans as well. We thus take advantage of sensitivity of all the six SAPHIR channels towards rainfall as provided by the probability distribution of brightness temperatures for rainy and non-rain cases, separately for all 182 pixel 6 locations (please note that Fig. 1 (a) â€“ (f) is just an example for pixel location # 45 over the oceans), and calculate the average probability of a given pixel as rainy (PR) and
