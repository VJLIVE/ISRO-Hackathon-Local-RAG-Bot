of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, (RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS guideline for WVWV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to Rawinsonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero.

Assuming the registration has an error of 1 pixel then error of the final product will be of 5 m/sec. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high-resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geo- stationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. WVWV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence
