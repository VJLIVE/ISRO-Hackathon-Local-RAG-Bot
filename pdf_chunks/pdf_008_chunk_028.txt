The rain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few seconds to any time scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random stochastic process. Therefore, rain comparisons in shorter time scales and from observations in different spatial scales lead to large errors (Piyush et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from modified H-E method with gridded dataset from IMD. The comparisons are carried out for each of the met subdivisions as provided in Table 7 to table 9. The comparison statistics is provided in Table 10. The Table 10 shows a reasonable good comparison statistics for different regions. If all regions are considered together, the comparison shows a correlation of 0.47 and rmse of 25.40 mm/day. In order to see this statistics in proper prospective, similar comparison statistics of rain from TRMM 3B42 V7 and IMD gridded dataset is provided in Table 11, which show slightly improved correlation of 0.53 and rmse of 19.30 mm/day. The difference may be due to geolocation error is INSAT-3D which is suspected to have mean error of 1-2 pixels in geolocation due to anomaly in the star sensor, which has potential to degrade statistics in smaller scales.
