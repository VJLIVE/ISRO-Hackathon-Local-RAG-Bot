Still this band is not completely transparent. Atmospheric water vapour and CO2 are the major components that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of the atmosphere. Since CO2 is a uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be taken care, but water vapour being highly variable its effect can only be removed by its measurement(directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires atmospheric corrections arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This correction is more in tropics during summers due to higher amount of atmospheric moisture (Barton 1983, Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). Our radiative transfer simulations studies have shown that with proper characterization of tropical marine conditions in the atmosphere, a suitable algorithm can be developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal window and mid IR thermal channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K. The regression equation to correct for atmospheric absorption and emission has the form Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 90 SST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2 (1) Where A0, A1, A2 and A3 are coefficients determined by simulation and may have satellite zenith angle dependence dT = T11 – T12 T11 and
