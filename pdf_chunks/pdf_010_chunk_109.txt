atmospheric absorption and emission has the form Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 90 SST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2 (1) Where A0, A1, A2 and A3 are coefficients determined by simulation and may have satellite zenith angle dependence dT = T11 – T12 T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels. To determine the regression coefficients in the above equation, radiative transfer simulations to generate INSAT-3D channels’ brightness temperatures for Indian marine tropical environmental conditions would be carried out. The important step in regression is to ensure that the sample dataset is fully and solely representative of the population for which the SST is to be derived. Instrument noise in simulated data for INSAT-3D channels would be introduced as per the availability from sensor team. A case study for SST retrieval using GOES-9 data (19th August 2005) yielded 0.68 K RMS deviation. 5.4.1.1.1 Radiative Transfer Model To simulate the brightness temperatures, MODTRAN is being used. MODTRAN is a computer code developed by Spectral Sciences Inc. and is designed to determine atmospheric transmittance and radiance at moderate resolution (1 cm-1). It is based on AFGL’s LOWTRAN-7 code. Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset has been used to construct the tropical marine subset. These profiles have been extracted from 500 S – 500 N and 300E – 1200E. The simulations have been performed on each radio sounding of the TIGR "tropical maritime" subset under the following conditions: -TIGR profiles are available on 48 levels. They have been converted to the 34 level MODTRAN inputs by using directly the TIGR levels from the surface to 300 hPa (15 levels), sampling every 4 levels above 300 hPa (5 levels are excluded this way) and removing the upper 9 levels. -In addition to the profiles of temperature and
