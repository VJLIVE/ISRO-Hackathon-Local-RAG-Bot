assume that the SSB value is 3.5% of SWH. A consolidated SSB solution will be computed about one year after launch, to interpolate the SSB value bilinearly from a table (empirical model derived from analyses of the altimeter data) as a function of SWH and wind speed. It should be noted that the bias reflects the combination of the mean errors from all of the corrections that are used to compute sea surface height. We expect very good SARAL/AltiKa data quality. However, some particular contributors have unknown or hard to estimate error contributions, simply because SARAL/AltiKa mission is so innovative (Ka-band altimeter) that a lack of information and experience prevents us to get a precise pre-launch error estimation: this is the case for “sea state bias correction”, “ionosphere correction for OGDR”, and “wind speed” error estimations.

Data Editing Criteria The following editing criteria are a recommended guideline for finding good records from the (O)(I)GDR version “d” to calculate the sea level anomaly from the Ku band range. The user should review these criteria before using them and may wish to modify them! First, check the following conditions to retain only ocean data and remove any bad, missing, or flagged data: Parameter Value Meaning surface_type 0 Open oceans or semi-enclosed seas ice_flag 0 No ice Table 12 : Recommended editing criteria Then, filter the data as follows to retain only the most valid data : Parameter Validity conditions range_numval 10 ≤ x range_rms 0 ≤ x (mm) ≤ 200 altitude – range -130 000 ≤ x (mm) ≤ 100 000 model_dry_tropo_corr -2 500 ≤ x (mm) ≤ - 1 900 rad_wet_tropo_corr -500 ≤ x (mm) ≤ - 1 iono_corr_alt -400 ≤ x (mm) ≤ 40 sea_state_bias -500 ≤
