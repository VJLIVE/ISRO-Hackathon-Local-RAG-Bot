flags). Instrument flags provide information about the state of the various instruments on the satellite. Telemetry flags are first based on instrument modes and checking of telemetry data quality. Only severely corrupted data are not processed (i.e. data that cannot be correctly read on ground). Flag setting is designed to get a maximum amount of data into the “Sensor Data Records” (part of the SGDR data sets). Science data are processed only when the altimeter is in tracking mode. Quality flags are determined from various statistical checks on the residuals after smoothing or fitting through the data themselves. These flags are set if gaps in the data are detected, or residuals have exceeded predetermined thresholds, or if the gradients of the data exceed predetermined thresholds.

Altimetric background Three previous high-accuracy altimetric missions, TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P, launched in August 1992 and which last until October 2005), Jason-1 (launched in December 2001) and Jason-2 (launched in June 2008) have been the key elements of a major turning point in physical oceanography, in terms of both scientific research and applications. Exceeding most initial specifications in terms of accuracy, T/P quickly became a unique tool to make significant progress in the understanding and modeling of ocean circulation and consequently on its climatic impact. The success of the T/P mission was mainly due to an appropriate optimization of the system: instruments, satellite, and orbit parameters were all specifically designed to fulfill the objectives of the mission. The T/P follow-on mission, Jason-1, was engaged soon after with the aim to provide the same level of performance, but with a significant decrease in weight and power needs, hence a much lower mission cost. In addition, near-real time applications were included in
