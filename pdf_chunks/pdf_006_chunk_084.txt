decide the precipitation amount. Due to this reason, it was not very easy to implement it with ease. Successively, an alternate method called Auto-Estimator was developed. The aim of the Auto-Estimator was to provide an automated method without human intervention and that could take care of the subjective nature of the IFFA, but this method a failed on many occasions because many features of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro- Estimator is most recent of the attempts by NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated. The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not present in IFFA or were defined differently. Till date there is no published literature on H-E method is available (or known to us). The method/procedure described in this document is based on pre-prints of a paper and personal communication with Dr. Robert Kuligowaski who pioneered in developing H-E method at NOAA/NESDIS. 4.2.2 Objectives:  To develop Hydro-Estimator method for precipitation measurement over Indian region encompassing area between longitudes 30 E -to130 E and latitudes 50 N - 50 S. 4.3 Inputs 4.3.1 Static Data: Topography data – Etopo – topography/elevation data from NGDC (USA).
