wind vector and antenna beam, the values of α, β and γ are generated to simulate the noisy backscatter (Oliphant and Long, 1999) as σ0Mi = σ0G i (1+Kpi.Xi) 18 where Xi is another independent Gausian random number with zero mean and the standard deviation K. The value of standard deviation K is normally unity, however, it can be varied for controlling the noise in simulation experiment. For noise free case, the value of K is zero and for noisy cases, it is varied from 1.0 to 2.0. The Kp is given by equation (7). While studying the impact of rain on wind vector retrieval, the rain model is used only for simulating the noisy backscatter data but not for the retrieval purpose. 5.1.2 Characteristics of wind retrieval across the inner beam swath: The simulation experiment carried out for noise free cases provides an insight into the characteristics of wind solutions at different locations of the swath. Over the sweet zone (Figure 9a) due to the optimum azimuth separation the sensitivity of cost function (NSD) with respect to aspect direction is higher. This leads to the retrieval skill relatively higher as compared to the other regions due to optimum azimuth separation as well as dual polarized multi-look measurements. Over near nadir region, despite dual polarization multi-look measurements, the azimuth separation is non-optimal leading to lower sensitivity of cost functions as seen in figure (9b) leading to reduced retrieval skill and higher errors. At the sub-satellite track, the retrieval skill is approximately halved due to 21 pairing of solutions in terms of ranking criterion as seen in figure (9c). The retrieval errors are also more due to non-optimal azimuth separation. (a) 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360 ASPECT DIRECTION (DEG) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
