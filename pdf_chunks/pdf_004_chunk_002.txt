The ATBD contains three major algorithms for derivation of wind vector solutions, directional ambiguity removal and rain flagging. It also describes two crucial aspects specific to Oceansat-2, firstly, the development of Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) needed for wind vector retrieval and secondly, the development of rain impact model necessary for rain flagging. In order to realize retrieval as well as flagging, requirements of different types of global data sets are also specified along with its utilization procedures. For deriving wind vector solutions, a new and efficient algorithm has been developed which is as good as Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) algorithm being used operationally for the earlier and ongoing global scatterometer missions. The algorithm developed
