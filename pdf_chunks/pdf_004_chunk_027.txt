of both the algorithms as shown are found to be almost comparable. Apart from this, comparison of distribution of directions retrieved using these algorithms is also performed as shown in figure (10b) and is also found to be mostly similar. Figure 10: Characteristics of MLE and NSD algorithms, a) Comparison of direction retrieval skills and wind vector errors, b) Distribution of derived wind direction solution closest to the true direction, (c) Comparison of algorithmsâ€™ performances and errors under varying noise conditions 23 Apart from comparison of performance of NSDA and MLE algorithms across the inner beam swath, impact of noise on retrieval performance has also been studied. Figure (10c) depicts the comparison of performances and errors of NSD and MLE algorithms under varying noise conditions for all the WVC indicating similarity of these algorithms. Thus, NSD algorithm is found be as good as MLE algorithm in respect of direction retrieval skill, wind vector errors and distribution of retrieved directions thus providing an alternative to MLE but with better computational efficiency. However, the errors in nadir regions are required to be improved using DIRTH algorithm developed by Stiles et al (2002). 5.2 Algorithm for directional ambiguity removal: A block diagram of directional ambiguity removal algorithm is depicted in figure (11). The ambiguity removal algorithm utilizes all the vector solutions available from retrieval algorithm over the data locations within the swath and the ambiguity is removed based on the trend or the consensus of the rank-1 wind directions solutions over that area. In most of the cases, about over half of the rank-1 wind directions are found to be aligned in the true wind directional pattern under normal noise conditions while the remaining rank-1 directions are mostly in the opposite direction. A median filtering approach is used to remove directional ambiguities. OPTIMUM
