forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics). Further details on science and applications of SARAL/AltiKa data products can be found in the ISRO- CNES SARAL/AltiKa Joint Science Plan document [AD2]. 2.3. SARAL/AltiKa Mission The SARAL/AltiKa mission is built on the heritage of T/P and Jason-1/2, with two driving ambitions: • Ensuring continuity of high quality measurements for ocean science • Providing operational products for assimilation and forecasting applications The SARAL mission has been set forth as a cooperation between CNES and ISRO. The sharing of responsibilities between CNES and ISRO, as defined in the SARAL MoU, is as follow : → CNES responsibilities : • Project Management: responsibility shared with ISRO • Overall SARAL system engineering • Integrated Payload Module (PIM), including o AltiKa mission payload o ARGOS-3 mission payload • Support for SARAL Payload Module integration and test • Ground System & Operations o Polar X-band network stations o Compatibility of L-band stations network required for the ARGOS-3/SARAL mission o Data communication network o AltiKa Mission Centre o NRT and OFL product processing software development, installation, training and support to operations (ISRO and EUMETSAT) o NRT product processing, archiving, distribution to users outside India, with the support of EUMETSAT o OFL product processing and distribution to users outside India o DORIS product processing and distribution o Data providing to the ARGOS Global Processing Centers o Archiving of all telemetry and products, and auxiliary data • User services • AltiKa System Coordination with other altimetry missions in the frame of the SALP service ;
