deviation is also provided along with CSBT values to help in deciding the spread of BT value for a given box. More standard deviation may help in flagging out some of the CSBT value as it may have some contamination of cloud (or cloud edges) 7.5.5. Quality indicators As it is already discussed in previous section that a flag and standard deviation values are generated along with CSBT product to provide user an indication of quality of CSBT value. The major confidence in quality is determined by the number of clear pixels with a grid box, if more than 50% of grid is covered by clear pixels then that box is given the highest confidence flag 0, but if this number is between 25 to 50% the flag=1 and if it between 10 to 25% then flag=2. These various flags are given to user to give them a flexibility in optimizing the number of data points in assimilation and the quality of data set. 7.6 Outputs 7.6.1 Format of the output and the domain 7.7. Validation 7.7.1. Data required Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager will be carried out by using various analysis such as NCMRWF analysis, GFS analysis and various reanalysis such as ERA interim reanalysis. These various analysis and reanalysis will be used to generate brightness temperatures using RTTOV or CRTM radiative transfer models. The validation cannot be carried out for each half-hourly product but validation will be carried out for only synoptic hours. For validation at specific time period special launch campaign is needed wherein various radiosondes are launched and these soundings could be used in conjunction with radiative transfer model for CSBT validation.
