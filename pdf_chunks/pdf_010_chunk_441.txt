3.2 Introduction 3.2.1 Overview and background Lifted index is an indicator of convective activity. It is calculated in the following steps. 1. Mean boundary layer (usually lowest 100 hPa layer) temperature and humidity are calculated. 2. A parcel of air with the above calculated temperature and humidity is lifted from the middle of the boundary layer dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level and then moist adiabatically up to 500 hPa. 3. The environmental temperature minus the parcel temperature at 500 hPa calculated in the above step is the lifted index (LI). If the parcel temperature is warmer than the environmental temperature it indicates that the parcel can rise further on its own and LI will be negative. Based on a large number of LI calculations from radiosonde observations, it is observed that LI less than -5 implies a very strong likelihood of thunderstorm activity. Time sequence of geographical pattern of LI may be monitored to study large scale convective activity and its relation to synoptic circulation systems (Hayden et al., 1996). 3.2.2 Objective To calculate Lifted Index (LIS) from temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from the INSAT sounder. 3.3 Inputs 3.3.1 Dynamic Data Sounder retrieved temperature and humidity profiles at standard pressure levels. 3.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 3.4.1 Overview 3.4.1.1 Theoretical Background Given boundary layer pressure, specific humidity and temperature, one can lift the parcel to 500 hPa dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level (LCL) and from LCL to 500 hPa moist adiabatically and thereby compute the parcel temperature at 500 hPa. Environmental temperature at 500 hPa is the retrieved temperature at 500 hPa.
