Contextual Algorithm (Giglio, et al., 1999: and Kaufman, et al., 1998) is proposed at this stage. A fire location represents the approximate location of the fire pixels and do not represent the actual fire size, which is usually much smaller than pixel size (4 km.). The INSAT at Nadir is 4x4 Km, for MIR and TIR, which is quite large, but the fire phenomenon is usually much smaller than that. Studies at Cooperative Institute of Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin have shown that the sub – satellite point, and smoldering at 450 K, in case of GOES (IFOV: 4x4Km) is approximately 0.5 to 1 acre in size in relatively non-cloudy conditions. Robinson (1991) has shown that due to very high amplification over background at 3.7 µm for forest fires occupying even a small fraction of a percent of an AVHRR pixel can substantially increase the mid IR brightness of the entire pixel. Therefore, fire (active fire) can be monitored at very low spatial resolution. 8.4.1.2 Algorithm Overview The fire detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding contextual technique, which includes multi band thresholds, and compares with the background. The algorithm will first masks out ocean, desert, water and cloud pixels and then proceed further. The contextual algorithms identify a fire pixel based on the level of contrast between the potential fire pixel and its “background” pixels (the definition of background varies according to kernel size). As opposed to the fixed threshold techniques, which must be defined for given regions and seasons, the contextual algorithm is supposed to be flexible and effective in different environmental conditions. Potential fire pixels
