height and cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are derived corresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder. These values are again derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the temperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 117 height formulae is used to compute cloud height for given temperature profile. Geopotential height (GPH) is then given by Z R Z R GPH o o   ---------- (10) Where Ro = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. For given pressure, temperature and humidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any pressure level or thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level can be computed using the formula ) ln( P P g T R Z s v d  --------- (11) Ps – Surface Pressure, P – Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, vT - Layer mean virtual temperature. This can be computed at all the retrieved pressure levels. Virtual temperature Tv is given by T q Tv ) 61 .0 1(   where q is specific humidity expressed in Kg/Kg, T is temperature in K. 10.8. Radiance bias adjustment It is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily dependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and fast forward RT model. If forward simulations are not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in retrieved products. To make observations and forward model simulations consistent, radiance bias adjustment is a necessary step. Radiance bias adjustment is carried out by previous eight days of good quality matchup data of INSAT-3D/3DR sounder clear-sky sounder observations and spatially and temporally collocated simulated INSAT-3D/3DR sounder radiances. The simulation is
