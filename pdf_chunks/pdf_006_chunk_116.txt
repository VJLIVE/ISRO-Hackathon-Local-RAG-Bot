ATBD Document, May 2015 96 absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at which that location is viewed by the INSAT (i.e., the matchup time window) is restricted to a maximum of ±30 minutes or ±15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the stipulated time window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal matchup subsequently have to pass a spatial test. A maximum distance of 0.1° will be accepted between an in situ SST location and the location of the central pixel in the INSAT extraction box. Measurement quality control: The climatological SST is then calculated for this box by spatial averaging and time interpolation. If the absolute value of the difference between the in situ measurement and the climatology is strictly below 20C the box is included into the database. 5.6.3 Technical issues (limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to simulate the satellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in radiative transfer model simulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST with reliable and concurrent insitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel observations and a channel sensitive to intervening atmospheric total water vapour content, the atmospheric correction applied is an indirect. The accuracy of this correction will heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model reanalysis for total water vapour. Major constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort focus in the following areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NET for each band, calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration- validation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, and timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit instrument NET performance
