Kishtawal Clear sky brightness temperature products from INSAT-3D/3DR Sounder for use in radiance assimilation in NWP model 8.2. Introduction The aim of Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) product is provide area average brightness temperatures (Tb) for representing cloud free pixels. These products have been recently developed by Space Applications Centre under INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) project to be used in radiance assimilation in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The high-temporal resolution data of INSAT-3D Sounder (hourly observations) would be extremely useful for monitoring and predicting of the fast developing weather systems through 4D-VAR radiance assimilation in NP models. 8.3.
