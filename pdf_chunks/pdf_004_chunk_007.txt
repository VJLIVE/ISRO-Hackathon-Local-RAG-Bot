of Oceansat-2 Scatterometer Figure 1a: Viewing geometry of Oceansat-2 Scatterometer 3.1 Oceansat-2 scatterometer data swath: Various types of the wind vector cells available from a pencil-beam scatterometer are depicted in figure (1b). Due to circular scanning of two beams at fixed incidence angles, areas of a particular size cut across the swath contain variable number of backscatter measurements impacting the wind retrieval. The entire swath can be divided Parameters Inner Beam Outer Beam Altitude 720 Km Look Angle 42.62° 49.38° Incidence Angle 48.9° 57.6° Swath 1400 Km 1840 Km One way 3-dB Beam Width 1.47° x 1.67° 1.47° x 1.67° One way 3-dB foot Print 26 Km X 46 Km 31 Km X 65 Km Nominal Slice Width (Across Scan) 8Km 8Km Inter center spacing along Track 19 Km 19 Km Inter center spacing along scan 15 Km 19 Km 4 into three zones namely exclusive outer beam zone referred as outer zone, sweet zone and nadir zone.

Over sweet zone, measurements available from both the beams with dual look directions also having good optimal azimuth diversity are very much suitable for better wind vector retrieval. Over nadir
