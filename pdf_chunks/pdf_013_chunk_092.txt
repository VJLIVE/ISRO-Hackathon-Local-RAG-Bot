RAMA buoys in the warm pool region of Indian Ocean used for the algorithm development for the period of 2002-2009. The OLR products have been obtained from EUMETSAT for the Indian Ocean coverage of the Meteosat-5 (sub-satellite point at 57°E) upto December 2006 and Meteosat-7 (sub- satellite point at 63°E) beyond January 2007. Meteosat derived OLR was estimated from the half- hourly observations in the thermal infrared (TIR, 10.5-12.5µm) and water vapor absorption (WV, 5.7-7.1µm) channels at spatial resolution of 5 km, using the algorithm developed by Schmetz and Liu [1988]. The accuracy of geostationary satellite derived OLR is shown to be ~3 W m-2 [Schmetz INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 80 and Liu, 1988; Singh et al., 2007] using radiative transfer model based simulation studies. The validation of geostationary satellite derived OLR with the broadband OLR observations from the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) onboard polar orbiting satellites TRMM and EOS-Terra reveal the accuracy to be ~7 W m-2 at a daily time-scale [Ba et al., 2003]. A collocated dataset of daily averaged SWR (24-hr average) using buoy data and daytime averaged OLR (duration of sunshine) was generated for each of the buoy locations. The daytime averaged OLR is obtained using average of the half-hourly observations between sunrise to sunset (computed using solar zenith angle less than 80o). A training dataset, using collocated observations from each of the buoys that represent complete annual cycle, was created for the algorithm development and the remaining data treated as the independent testing dataset. SAC-Algorithm [Shahi et al., 2011] o used the normalized SWR w.r.t. the nadir viewing angle, i.e. SWR sec2(), in the empirical formulation, where  is solar zenith angle at local noon. The polynomial least square equation between normalized SWR and OLR was found to be: (SWR)
