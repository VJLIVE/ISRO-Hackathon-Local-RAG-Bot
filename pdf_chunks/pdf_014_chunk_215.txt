IMSRA rainfall estimates, one of the simplest and state-of-the-art techniques, called the successive correction method (Cressman, 1959; Thiebaux and Pedder, 1987) has been found suitable enough for objective analysis,. It involves the successive modification of satellite rainfall estimates based on observed rain gauge rainfall data. The objective analysis scheme benefits from the relative advantages of satellite and in situ data. In this method, the background field is corrected by the observed values iteratively during several analysis scans until the correction between the interpolated value and actual observation converges (Gairola et al. 2015). The interpolated weights are computed using the distance-dependent scheme and the correction (C) (Cressmaqn 1959) is done using the following equation: C = ( ∑W (P0 – Pp)) / N (1) where Po is rainfall at the observation point, Pp is the interpolated grid point data at observation point, N is the number of observations, and the weight (W) is given by W= (R2 – d2) / (R2 + d2) for d2 ≤ R2 = 0 for d2 > R2 (2) where R is the radius of rainfall influence and d is the distance of the in situ data point from the grid point. The appropriate radius of rainfall influence is determined by the spatial autocorrelation analysis of daily IMSRA derived rainfall data. In recent study by Gairola et al. 2015), the objective analysis applied for rainfall estimates show noticeable improvement over the satellite-based INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 185 rainfall estimates. Comparison with independent rain gauge observations shows a considerable improvement in terms of correlation, bias and root-mean-square error after objective analysis, especially over the regions where density of rain gauge is fairly good. Overall results reveal that the synergistic use of satellite and in situ observations has potential for more accurate rainfall estimations over the
