uncertainties in the accuracies of the retrievals. Cloud resolving models such as the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE), which is a cloud microphysical model developed mainly by Tao and Simpson, (1993), or the Tripoli, (1992), model are used to supply the required cloud structures. For each cloud model time step, radiative transfer computations are supposed to be performed at high resolution. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 20 Databases are generated separately for different freezing heights to capture the different dynamics of tropical rainfall systems. Once a database of profiles and associated brightness temperatures is established, the retrieval employs a straightforward inversion methodology. In the absence of a suitable cloud model data base this approach will be taken up as a R & D effort. Meanwhile, for an alternate operational algorithm development, an equally workable approach of the detection of rain over ocean would be employed. following For this purpose the data base of TRMM-TMI, and SSM/I radiometric TBs will be collocated with TRMM-Precipitation Radar over the global oceans. This data base will be used to develop a robust set of relationships with the SSM/I sensor (since the frequency channels and footprints of SSM/I are similar to MADRAS compared to TRMM-TMI). A matched data base of SSM/I-TBs and buoy and ship based rainfall would also be created based on the observations all over the tropical oceanic regions. Further refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and Ferraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could best predict the 85 GHz Tb under "nonscattering" conditions for the ocean surface in question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, a measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could be determined. The form of the Scattering Index
