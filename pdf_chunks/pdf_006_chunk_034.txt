empirical relationship was then applied on FY-2D measured radiances to obtain the INSAT-3D radiances. These FY-2D measured radiances and the INSAT-3D simulated radiances using FY-2D measured radiances and collocated CERES OLR were used to develop the OLR algorithm (under second approach: ALG-2). In both approaches (ALG-1 and ALG-2), genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the optimum relationship between broadband flux (OLR) and spectral radiances of WV and thermal infrared channels. A unique advantage of GA is that complex (often nonlinear) relationships between different variables can be obtained in the form of simple and usable equations. In the case of other nonlinear methods like ANN, the task of using the algorithm often requires a complete understanding of the neural network, which includes a complex array of input layers, hidden layers, the shape of the response function at each layer, and the weights connecting these layers. A major difference between other nonlinear techniques (like ANN) and GA is that the algorithm development under GA is almost completely objective and data adaptive. The development of the OLR retrieval algorithm involves a number of steps. In the first step, the collocated data of narrowband radiances (both FY-2D and INSAT-3D), satellite zenith angle and OLR were divided into two unequal random samples. Sample I is used to train the GA and Sample II is used for evaluation of the algorithm. Genetic algorithm (GA) was then applied to find optimal relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR for Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 37 training data (Sample I). The GA training provides empirical equations (INSAT-3D as well as FY-2D) relating OLR to narrowband radiances and satellite zenith angle. The root mean square error (rmse) on the training data is about 7 Wm-2. The developed algorithm was applied on the Sample-II data in
