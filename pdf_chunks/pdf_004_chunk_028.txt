In most of the cases, about over half of the rank-1 wind directions are found to be aligned in the true wind directional pattern under normal noise conditions while the remaining rank-1 directions are mostly in the opposite direction. A median filtering approach is used to remove directional ambiguities. OPTIMUM MEDIAN FILTER WINDOW HIGHEST RANK WIND VECTOR SOLUTION FIELD RESOLVE HIGHEST RANK VECTOR SOLNS FIELD INTO SCALAR FIELD CHOOSE SOLN CLOSEST TO MEDIAN VECTOR & SWAP SOLNS IF REQUIRED MEDIAN WIND VECTOR FIELD YES CHECK FOR CONVERGENCE OF HIGHEST RANK SOLNS FIELD AMBIGUITY FILTERED WIND VECTOR FIELD MEDIAN SCALAR WIND FIELDS ITERATE PROCESS NO Figure 11: Block diagram of directional ambiguity removal algorithm 24 For this purpose, the rank-1 vectors over an area are first resolved into scalar components. With a moving window of optimized size, medians of both the scalars at each data location are determined using all the points falling within the window. The medians of respective scalars are used to find the median wind direction at each data location. Making use of median direction, all the direction solutions at that point are examined and the direction solution closest to median direction is identified and that vector is assigned as rank-1 solution swapping with its original ranking (Gohil, 1992). The procedure is followed for all the points in a scene cut out of the satellite pass and likewise the entire pass is processed. The filtering process for a scene is repeated in the above-mentioned manner till the entire processed wind field of that scene is converged. At this stage, the resulting wind field mostly resembles the true wind field in that scene. It is important to note that the retrieval of ambiguity filtered wind vector field is mainly dependent on the amount of noise present in radar backscatter
