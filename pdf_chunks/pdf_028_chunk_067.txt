deviations can be easily calculated for the four cloud categories. In the LW/SW graph (Figure-1), the centre of the ellipse represents the average SW-LW radiances and the areas describe the standard deviation. The cloud fraction of a measurement is determined by its location on this plane. For each ScaRaB measured SW-LW pair, probabilities for being each case are calculated. The highest probability identifies the cloud fraction. Figure-1: Equiprobability Ellipses for MLE. Clr (clear), PC (partly cloudy), MC (mostly cloudy), OV (overcast). (From Wielicki and Green, 1989). 5.2.1.3 LW Scene Identification This scene identification is done for night-time. The algorithm proceeds with the following steps: Step-1 Search the geographic information Ngeo From latitude and longitude, the following variables are searched: Ngeo : Geo-type (ocean, land, desert, snow-ice, coast) Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 59 Mgeo : Outgoing clear sky flux (Wm-2) For the earlier ScaRaB missions, the geo-type map was updated each month to take into account the variation of snow at high latitudes. For Megha-Tropiques such an update may be not necessary due to the negligible snow cover variation in the 30ï‚° tropical coverage belt. The Mgeo dataset is also defined on monthly basis. Then the Mgeo corresponding to land and desert regions are corrected for diurnal variations. Step-2 Compute the theoretical outgoing flux M from Mgeo and ADM For each cloud category ( 1 to 4): M(Iscn, Colat) = Mmod (Iscn, Colat) + Fc [Mgeo(Colat, Lon) - Mmod (Ngeo, Colat)] ---(2) where Fc is is related to the cloud fraction Fc = 1 for clear Fc = 0.75 for partly cloudy Fc = 0.25 for mostly cloudy Fc = 0 for overcast It is easy to check: M (Iscn, Colat) = Mmod (Iscn, Colat) for overcast M (Iscn, Colat) = Mgeo(Colat, Lon) for clear sky Step-3 Compute the theoretical LW
