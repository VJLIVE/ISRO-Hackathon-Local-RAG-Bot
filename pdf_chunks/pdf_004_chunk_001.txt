This document describes the various algorithms to be used for the retrieval of ocean surface wind vector from the OCEANSAT-II satellite scatterometer data. The document contains details of algorithms for extraction of wind vector solutions, wind directional ambiguity removal and flagging of rain and sea-ice. It also describes the procedures for post-launch development of geophysical model function (GMF) and rain impact model necessary for operational wind retrieval and rain flagging. Also described here are the simulation based studies using Quikscat GMF and rain impact models for wind vector retrieval, noise impact on retrieval and rain flagging. 10 Classification General 11 Circulation All concerned Sr. No. CONTENTS Page No. Summary 1.0 Introduction 1 2.0 Scatterometer measurements 1 3.0 Oceansat-2 scatterometer system 2 3.1 Oceansat-2 scatterometer data swath 3 3.2 Geophysical products specifications 4 3.3 Oceansat-2 scatterometer data processing flow 5 4.0 Geophysical model function 5 4.1 Prevailing GMF 6 4.2 GMF development procedures 7 4.2.1 Post-launch ancillary data requirements for GMF development 11 5.0 Wind vector retrieval and the state of art 12 5.1 Algorithm for retrieval of wind
