calculated using radiative transfer simulated database of brightness temperatures under raining and non-raining conditions. This is shown schematically in Fig. 2 below. Fig. 2: Scheme for simulation of brightness temperatures for SSM/I and MADRAS using NCEP environment fields and finding regression relation for expected brightness temperature at 85.5 GHz (SSM/I) / 89 GHz (MADRAS). In the next step a regression based relationship is established between SI (SSM/I) and SI (MADRAS). This relationship is used to estimate expected SI (SSM/I) for given SI (MADRAS). According to Ferraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. (1996), rain is expected when SI > 10. We use the same value of SI for identifying rain event.

We therefore restrict the CLW value for the retrieval of the TPW and WS to 50 mg cm-2 and 18 mg cm-2, respectively (Wentz, 1997). Thus if CLW exceeds these thresholds values, the TPW and WS are not retrieved. Inversion Techniques: Inversion techniques that are proposed to be employed have their heritage from MSMR, are essentially statistical techniques in which relationships between the predictors and the predictants are established. A general inversion technique is mathematically represented by the following expression:   Tb D G  *  Here, G is a vector whose elements are various geophysical parameters which is related to a measurement basis function vector φ(Tb) of simulated brightness temperatures Tb by a matrix D. The measurement basis function vector
