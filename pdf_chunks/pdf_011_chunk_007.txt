Tsfc is the a priori estimate of SST that can be taken from the climatology or from the forecast of the numerical weather prediction models. All other variables are same as in equation (3). The multiplication factor Tsfc is used to scale the correction factor due to atmospheric water vapor. We have also tried to experiment with the brightness temperature of TIR1 as a multiplying factor, which yields very similar result. However, in order to avoid occasional large noise in the TIR1 BT we retain Tsfc as the multiplying factor as in the original algorithm proposed by Walton et al. (1998). 3.1.2 Radiative Transfer Model Since frequency bands and their spectral response functions of INSAT-3DR and INSAT-3D are almost similar, the transmission coefficients file of INSAT-3D required to simulate brightness SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 8 temperatures through PFAAST radiative transfer (RT) model can be used for simulating INSAT- 3DR brightness temperatures. Therefore, we have simulated the brightness temperatures corresponding to INSAT-3DR thermal and mid-IR channels through PFAAST RT model. The atmospheric profiles and required surface variables has been taken from ECMWF diverse data set. The simulations have been performed for the clear atmospheres over oceanic region spanning from 0E – 130E and 60S – 60N only, and for satellite zenith angle from 0 to 60 degrees. 3.1.3 Cloud detection In the present algorithm, the cloudy pixels are flagged using INSAT-3DR level-2 cloud mask product. In absence of the INSAT-3DR cloud mask product the cloudy pixels are detected through cloud mask routine based on threshold and spatial coherence techniques in visible, MIR and thermal bands. Threshold technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness temperature in thermal band (TIR-1)
