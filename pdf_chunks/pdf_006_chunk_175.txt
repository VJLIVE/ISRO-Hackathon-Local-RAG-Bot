and difference of these two channels is implemented to screen out opaque cirrus and stratus clouds. Since clouds usually have cold tops, they have low brightness temperatures in TIR-1 channel. Further the large difference in the brightness temperatures between the MIR and the TIR-1 channels due to the reflection of solar energy at 3.9µm is succesful in screening out water clouds. Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 146 Fifth pass Test: Thresholds are placed on the brightness temperature of TIR-1, TIR-2 and difference of these two channels is implemented to screen out low level moisture and cirrus clouds. Thresholding based on differences between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and TIR-2 are widely used for cloud screening and is often referred to as the split window technique. Pseudo Channel Index (PCI) Test : Even after applying the above tests , misclassification between smoke and clouds is possible. For further screening, pseudo channel (CLD) is made use of and defined as: Visible) ( (TIR2) Visible) ( (TIR2) CLD    (3) where TIR2 and Visible refer to the radiation received in 12 μm and 0.65 μm channels respectively [5]. Owing to their different signatures in the pseudo channel, smoke plumes and clouds can be discriminated using a CLD threshold. Although in earlier studies CLD and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) feature space analysis was used for categorization of smoke and cloud, it was found to generate false alarms and was eventually improved by using multi-temporal change detection technique. However, in this study, it has been found that combining CLD with conventional multi-threshold test also improves the robustness of smoke detection. Thus pixels are further required to pass the following test, 1 CLD C  (4) where ‘C1’ is the threshold value for smoke plumes. If a pixel passes all these 5 tests,
