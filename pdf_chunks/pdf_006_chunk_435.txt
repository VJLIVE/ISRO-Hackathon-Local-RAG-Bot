Generally high pressure areas have relatively higher geopotential heights than low pressure areas. It is also a fundamental quantity that is used in atmospheric general circulation models. At mid-latitudes they also indicate the underlying large-scale waves such as Rossby waves. By looking at the geopotential heights one can infer the first guess atmospheric wind pattern (also known as geostrophic approximation) especially for mid- latitudes. 1.2.2 Objective To derive geopotential heights at 40 pressure
