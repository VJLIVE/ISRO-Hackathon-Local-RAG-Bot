Processing for discrimination between radiances from cloud free sea surface and those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 1.4.1.1.4 Step-3. Correction for atmospheric attenuation is taken care in SST computation for multichannel SST retrieval, but in case of availability of only one thermal channel, total water vapour field will be required externally from model output. Step-4. Computation of SST During daytime, for cloud free pixels, SST is computed as SST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2 Where A0, A1, A2, and A3 are coefficients determined by regression and may have satellite zenith angle dependence. dT = T11 – T12 T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels During Nighttime, for cloud free pixels, SST is computed as SST= A0 + A1T3 + A2dT + A3dT2 Where A0, A1, A2, and A3 are coefficients determined by regression and may have satellite zenith angle dependence. dT = T11 – T12 T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels and T3 is the brightness temperature for channel 3 of IMAGER. Single channel SST is computed as SST = a + b*Tb +c*WV Where Tb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water vapour content, a, b and c are regression coefficients generated through radiative transfer simulations and may have satellite zenith angle dependence.

Satellite data are flagged 3(highest quality SST) if the absolute difference between the satellite SST and the climatology is strictly below 30 C and the channel 5 standard deviation is lower or equal to 10 C. If both the criterion are not true, flag value is put as 2. In case of cloudy pixel, flag value is 1. Pixels over land are flagged as
