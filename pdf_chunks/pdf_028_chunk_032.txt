of error: 1) Availability of Cloud resolving model simulations 2) Coastal boundaries. 3) Beam Filling Error 4) Vertical distribution of Hydrometeors 5) The freezing level retrieval These error sources are very critical and needs to be followed with active groups working at various places elsewhere (in country or abroad). 2.10 Future Scope: In the present document the possibilities of both physical and empirical algorithms for rainfall retrieval are highlighted. However due to certain limitations the empirical algorithm has been emphasized as an operational one. It would be based on the radiatiatve transfer simulations as the pointers to optimize the frequency channels. This is also important in view of the different noise scenario of the different channels to be known only after the launch of the satellite. Based on the performance of the algorithm over global tropical ocean and land, the fine tuning will be carried out. The ongoing advanced research on radiative transfer based algorithm will be worked out in future to generate the data base for retrievals. However, in any case an algorithm would be in place for its global applicability at par with the algorithms elsewhere for different satellite sensors like TRMM, SSM/I and GPM. 2.11 Reference 1.
