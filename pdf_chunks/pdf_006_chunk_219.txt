attainable from WVWV is quite uniform in most cases, since the observed displacement Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 185 of a large portion of the targeted features is a result of pure moisture advection and adequately represents the instantaneous wind. The coverage is especially complete in the summertime tropics due to the presence of abundant moisture. However there are situations when extraction of useful WVWV information is difficult, if not impossible. These situations are summarized as: 1) very dry air masses lacking in moisture features, which prohibits good target selection; 2) regions of strong vertical motion, in which a coherent radiance signal can be significantly attenuated over the tracking interval; 3) uniform moisture fields lacking in contrast; 4) strong vertical shear zones, which can be deform targets over the tracking interval; and 5) rapidly amplifying extra-tropical troughs, which contain a large phase speed component. The above conditions represent relatively rare situations when considering full-disk coverage. As a whole the coverage and quality of WVWV will vary depending on atmospheric factors such as moisture availability and structure, vertical shear, and instrument characteristics such as detector precision and resolution. 12.4.1.1 Methodology The main components for the process of WVWV detection are the following:  Tracer selection  Height assignment  Tracking  Wind buffer generation and Quality control Before going to details, a crux of such approaches is given in the following steps:  The tracer whose displacement is to be detected in subsequent WV image frames is selected.  Let the source image s and target image t is registered to same scale. For every given m x m (typically 32 x 32 pixels) sub-image cs of the tracer in image s, an n x n (n > m) search window wt is selected in t. The center
