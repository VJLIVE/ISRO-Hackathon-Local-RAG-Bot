selected by computing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:    i j I j i I a ) , ( (1) Where  j i I , represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). As per the location of the tracer, the template window is re-located with tracer position at the centre. A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2 11.4.1.1.2 Height assignment The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived using the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) technique or the water vapor histogram method (HIST), the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: 2.1 Infrared Window Channel (WIN) and Water Vapor Histogram Methods (HIST): In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 168 forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location.
