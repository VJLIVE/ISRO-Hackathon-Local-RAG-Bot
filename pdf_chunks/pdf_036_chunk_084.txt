set if the absolute value of the difference between the model wet tropospheric correction and the dual frequency wet tropospheric correction retrieved from 23.8 GHz and 37.0 GHz brightness temperatures exceeds a specified threshold, OR if the number of valid 40-Hz altimeter range of the processed measurement is smaller than a specified threshold. If the corresponding computations cannot be performed, then the ice flag is set if a climatological map predicts ice at the given location, and if the wind speed derived from the altimeter measurement is less than 1 m/s, i.e., the backscatter is larger than normally expected from the ocean. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 57 Disclaimer: Users are advised to use this flag carefully because it is linked to conditions relative to altimeter wind speed (derived from sigma naught values). As it was not possible to assess precisely the sigma naught before launch, all derived parameters may not be representative and are subject to tuning at the beginning of the mission. 5.9. Tides Tides are a significant contributor to the observed sea surface height [LeProvost, 2001]. While they are of interest in themselves, they have more variation than all other time-varying ocean signals. Since they are highly predictable, they are removed from the data in order to study ocean circulation. There are several contributions to the tidal effect: the ocean tide, the load tide, the solid earth tide and the pole tide. The ocean tide, load tide and solid earth tide are all related to luni-solar forcing of the earth, either directly as is the case of the ocean and solid earth tide, or indirectly as is the case with the load tide since it is forced by the ocean tide. The pole tide is due to variations in the earthâ€™s
