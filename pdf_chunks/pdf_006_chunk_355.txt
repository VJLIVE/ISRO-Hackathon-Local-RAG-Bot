is the emissivity difference,  =(j) and a1 to a6 are the SW coefficients to be determined from simulation data. 18.4 Method and Data Used in the Study 18.4.1 Methodology A flowchart depicting the steps followed in the proposed algorithm is shown in the figure 4. The split-window algorithm requires a forward simulation study for generating split- window coefficients through the RT model using various inputs (details discussed in the next sections). With the use of these split-window coefficients and emissivity information, the radiance observed at the top-of-atmosphere by the INSAT-3D Imager sensor is converted into the LST. The LST images generated from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor can then be compared with (a) K1-LST products available on MOSDAC archival system and (b) MODIS LST products available through the NASA’s archival system. The individual components of this flowchart have been discussed in details in the following sub-sections.

Many types of the SW algorithms have been developed for the LST retrieval. In an earlier analysis reported in a paper (Pandya et al., 2011b), various SW algorithms were evaluated for LST retrieval from the INSAT-3D Imager
