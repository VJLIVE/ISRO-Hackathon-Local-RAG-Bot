each of the antenna beams pointing to the cell. The cells with only four beams are used for the simulation studies. At these WVC, radar backscatter data are simulated using QSCAT-1 geophysical model function (rsd@zephyr2.jpl.nasa.gov) for simulated wind vector with wind speed and direction values varied within the specifications of QSCAT-1 GMF. The details of QSCAT-1 GMF are available online (Dunbar, 1999). The GMF backscatter value for any relative wind vector and incidence angle within GMF specifications can be obtained through bi-linear interpolation. The modification of simulated backscatter due to rain is realized through the rain model (Draper and Long, 2004) yielding the path integrated attenuation PIA and the lump rain backscatter contribution σ0 rw as functions of integrated rain rate R expressed in km.mm/hr as σ0 r = e-PIA.σ0 g + σ0 rw 16 Based on Quikscat data (25 km BUFR Format) for one orbit, the most prevalent values of α, β and γ with their respective standard deviations are used for simulating noisy backscatter data for testing the algorithms. These parameters, in general, are expressed here as Y(j) = Ym + V(j) 17 where Y may be α, β or γ, with Ym as respective mean representative value. The Gausian random variable V(j) has zero mean and standard deviation as observed in Quikscat data given in table (4). 20 Table 4: Kp parameters of Quikscat data Kp Parameter (Y) Ym V D (kp_alpha-1) 1.0.10-2 0.3.10-2 E 1.0.10-5 0.3.10-5 J 1.0.10-7 0.3.10-7 For each case of wind vector cell, wind vector and antenna beam, the values of α, β and γ are generated to simulate the noisy backscatter (Oliphant and Long, 1999) as σ0Mi = σ0G i (1+Kpi.Xi) 18 where Xi is another independent Gausian random number with zero mean and the standard deviation K.
