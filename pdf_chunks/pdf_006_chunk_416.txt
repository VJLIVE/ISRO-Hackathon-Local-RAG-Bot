550 nm (AOD550) as alternative to 3D aerosol product 20.4 Algorithm functional specifications The algorithm uses a clear-sky model with spectrally integrated radiative transfer scheme that requires solar zenith angle, elevation, slope, aspect of terrain, aerosol, water vapour and ozone as inputs. This accounts for depletion of instantaneous incoming solar radiation flux due to atmospheric perturbances or turbidity. In cloudy-sky, a separate three-layer scheme was implemented where cloud is assumed plane parallel sandwitched between upper and lower cloudless atmospheric layers. 20.4.1. Clear-sky model 20.4.1.1 Direct or beam irradiance . A simple but accurate spectral irradiance model (Paulescu and Schlett 2003) was used to determine instantaneous direct or beam irradiance (in Wm-2) over the entire shortwave range (0.3 to 3 m). An integrated spectral (10 nm interval) atmospheric transmittance scheme developed by them was used in the Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 343 present study. The instantaneous direct or beam irradiance over the entire shortwave region was computed in Wm-2 as, (1) = (2) Where, = ozone transmittance, Rayleigh transmittance, water vapour transmittance, aerosol transmittance, transmittance of other gases, = solar constant (1367 Wm-2), = Instantaneous irradiance (Wm-2) at top-of-atmosphere, = calendar day The Rayleigh transmittance, , was computed as, (3) The was computed over 10 nm interval and integrated over whole shortwave spectrum. The digital elevation model (DEM) were used to compute and Rayleigh transmittance for each pixel. Here, is optical airmass at a given atmospheric pressure ‘p’ and  is wavelength (m) The relative optical airmass, , is computed as : s+ 0.15(93.885 - s)-1.253] (4) Here, = solar zenith angle The generalized form of integrated spectral transmittance for a given atmospheric quantity, , has the following functional form : (5) Here, for ozone ( = ozone content in atm-cm), for water vapour ( =
