Wind speed For calculation of ET0, wind speed measured at 2 meter above the surface is required. To adjust wind speed data obtained from instruments placed at elevations other than the standard heights of 2 meter, a logarithmic wind speed profile may be used for such conversion. ) 42 .5 82 . 67 ln( 87 .4 2   z u u Z INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 210 2 u = wind speed at 2 meter above ground surface [m s-1] Z u = measured wind speed at z meter above ground surface [m s-1] z = height of measurement above ground surface [m] 17.4.11.
