with the PR thresholds. Figure 4 shows the cumulative probability distribution of rain rates for such pixels. The rain rate is calculated from an algorithm discussed in the next section. From the Fig. 4, we find that for oceans (open triangles) about 80% of the non-raining pixels that give false rain produce an average rain of less than 0.15 mm/h. About 95% of such pixels produce average rain of less than 0.35 mm/h, whereas for land about 52 % of the non-raining pixels give an average rain of 0.15 mm/h, and 95 % of such pixels produce an average rain less than 0.65 mm/h and none of them yield average rain of more than 0.95 mm/h. Thus, with the PR based rain/no-rain threshold, the rainy pixels that are classified as producing missing-rain and the non-rainy pixels that are classified as producing false- rain has effect only in the low rain regime (i.e., < 1 mm/h). Given the errors in the rain estimation by the microwave radiometers (Varma et al., 2010, Varma and Pal, 2012), and the error involved in the spatial-temporal collocation of the SAPHIR-PR dataset, this error in the rain identification can be considered as insignificant. Hence, with a PR threshold of 0.6 and 0.63 as discussed above, we generate rain/no-rain map from 7 SAPHIR and also from TRMM 3B42 standard dataset. Figure 5 shows rain/no-rain map for a typical day of 11 May 2013. Due to rain identification problem in very low rain regime, we have deliberately avoided low rain rates of < 0.25 mm/h. Again the SAPHIR rain is determined using the rain retrieval algorithm discussed in the next section. The Fig. 5 shows that rain area by SAPHIR matches fairly well with that from 3B42. 3.
