ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud flagging and the spatial resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected to produce substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily insolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 311 humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional product of potential evapo-transpiration. 19.2.2 Objectives The objectives of this document are : (i) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ETo) based on Penman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model) (ii) To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs average operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution to generate product of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution (iii)To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for automation of ETo product generation (iv) To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results 19.2.3 Instrument and characteristics of input products 19.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D) The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system, which was launched at geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR (1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with nineteen sounder channel. The spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for MIR, WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the bands
