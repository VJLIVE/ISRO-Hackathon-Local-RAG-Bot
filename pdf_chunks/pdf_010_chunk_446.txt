It is given by the formula ) exp( T C Lq p e   Where  - Potential temperature, L – Latent heat of condensation, q – Specific humidity, T – Temperature, Cp – Specific heat of dry air at constant pressure. As the moisture decreases with height, e also decreases with height and reaches a minimum in the middle troposphere, then increases again into the upper troposphere. The maximum vertical e differential between the boundary layer and middle troposphere is a measure of atmospheric instability in the vertical direction. Larger the theta-e differential, more unstable is the atmosphere in the vertical direction. A quantity called dry microburst potential index (MDPI) is calculated by dividing thetaed by 30. As this formula for MDPI is empirical, its suitability over the Indian region needs to be studied. 5.2.2 Objective To calculate thetaed from sounder retrieved temperature and humidity profile. 5.3 Inputs 5.3.1 Dynamic Data Temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from the sounder.
