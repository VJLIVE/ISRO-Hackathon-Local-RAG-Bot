Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 268 Annexure-1 Instrument Characteristics: INSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection during daytime. Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise sensitivity are summarized in the table-1. A flat elliptical scan mirror mounted at 45ï‚° to the optical axis intercepts the radiation and reflects it on to 310mm reflective telescope. At the telescope, dichroic beam splitters separate the visible spectrum and three IR coarse bands. The three IR bands then pass through the concentric
