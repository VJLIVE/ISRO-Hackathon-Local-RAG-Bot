while INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived at 0015, 0045, 0115 UTC respectively. The AMV derived from these satellites are widely accepted by different national and international operational agencies. In the present study, the algorithm for deriving AMVs using infrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode is demonstrated. Subsequently, this new AMVs generated using staggering mode will bee inter- compared with individually retrieved INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR AMVs. 14.2.2. Objective The availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic and region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated to re-look further for the improvement in retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason for this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of winds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. The main objective of this study is to derive the algorithm for retrieving AMVs using infrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode. 14.3. Inputs 14.3.1.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 14.4.1. Methodology The operationally four different spectral channels of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are used to derive AMVs over the Indian Ocean region and operational retrieval algorithm is described in Deb et al. 2016. In the present document, a new staggering algorithm is discussed where data from infrared (i.e. TIR1) and water vapor (i.e. WV) channels of both the satellites
