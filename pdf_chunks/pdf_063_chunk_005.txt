can be used to store and digital satellite image data, scanned aerial photos, elevation models, scanned maps and the results of many types of geographic analysis. TIFF is the only full-featured format in the public domain, capable of supporting extension to include geographic metadata. GeoTIFF implements the geographic metadata formally, using compliant TIFF tags and structures. A GeoTIFF file actually contains geographic (or cartographic) data attached as tags within the TIFF file. The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and geometry on the screen of a geographic information display. GeoTIFF is a metadata format, which provides geographic information to associate with the image data. But the TIFF file structure allows both the metadata and the image data to be encoded into the same file. GeoTIFF makes use of a public tag structure which is platform interoperable between any and all GeoTIFF- readers. The GeoTIFF format is supported by TIFF – 6.0. That is, the GeoTIFF images conform in every way to the TIFF formal specifications. The tags used for the "Geo" portion of the TIFF format conform to the acceptable and customary use of "private" or "registered" TIFF tags. The GeoTIFF tags and definitions are considered completely to the baseline and extended TIFF tag definitions currently supported in TIFF-6 by Aldus Corp. 2.2 Details of Level 4 products: A set of geographic parameters required to interpret the product for each category has been defined. This set is used for placing geographic information in GeoTIFF in form of tags (or keys). The sets for various categories of products are shown in Table 4 below: Table 4 (a) Parameters of INDIA and GLOBAL products Paramter Value for INDIA Value for GLOBAL 0.02° Value for GLOBAL 0.0625° OutputLineSpacing 0.02 0.02 0.0625 OutputPixelSpacing 0.02 0.02 0.0625
