a non-linear iterative physical algorithm (Li et al., 2000, Ma et at. 1999, Seeman at al. 2003) is applied to the RTE to improve the solution. For non-scattering atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiative transfer equation may be written as: Following derivation by Li et al (1994) the RTE may be written as linear perturbation form: ) 13 ( ) ( . )) ( ln( . ) ( . . 1 1 1              ls i o ls i ls i q t s ts b i T K i q K i T K T K T      or simply, Y= K.X ------------ (14) Where, perturbation- is with respect to an a priori estimate or mean-conditions. Tb is Sounder channel brightness temperature, and Kts, Kt, Kq and Ko are weighting functions (also known as Jacobian) of surface skin temperature, atmospheric temperature profile, humidity profile and ozone profile respectively. Analytical forms of these weighting functions are derived in Li et al (2000) have the following form: ) 12 ( .) 0 ( )]. ( [ ) 0 ( ).
