Simulations were carried out based upon a number of model inputs to derive a set of coefficients from the atmospheric functions particularly tuned for the Imager sensor. These SW coefficients were then used to generate the LST product. The total theoretical modelling error ranged from 0.8 K (for view zenith angle equal to 0 degree) to 1.6 K (for view zenith angle equal to 55 degree) with an average error of 1.1 K. The LST derived using the proposed method was validated with the Kalpana-1 VHRR LST and MODIS LST products for day and night Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 303 datasets. This inter-comparison brought out the fact that the proposed algorithm provided encouraging results with a very good match of 3D-LST with other reference LST estimates. The comparison of satellite derived LST with other two satellite observations over India showed a fairly good agreement between satellite estimates, with a R2 value up to 0.79 and RMSE of 1.37 K for 3D Vs. MODIS comparison, while a R2 value up to 0.81 and RMSE of 1.1 K for 3D Vs. K1 comparison. The overestimation in the case of daytime observations in the 3D LST is to be explored in the future. A robust cloud removal algorithm has to be developed and applied on the LST images. The method developed in this report provides a theoretical base for generation of operational LST products over India from the INSAT-3D Imager data.
