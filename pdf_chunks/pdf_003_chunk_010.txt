critical aspect of the ensemble-based approach in high-dimensional coupled models is the generation of a large number of ensembles or particles needed to closely approximate the posterior probability density of the system. Particle generation in this study is done using bootstrapping sampling by introducing random biases to the background field (Bhowmick et al 2019). This approach substantially reduces the computational time required for particle generation, which otherwise needs a distinct model run for each particle generation in the conventional particle filter techniques. The random Gaussian biases are computed with zero mean and 0.5 mg/m3 standard deviation. Here, we used standard deviation of the model chlorophyll to define the PDF of random biases. The randomly introduced biases are then modified for each model grid point with respect to both the model chlorophyll values at each grid point and the model bias. In this way, the correction term added to the model chlorophyll varies spatially with respect to the values of chlorophyll at that grid location. Model bias is computed from the long-term model simulations with respect to satellite-derived chlorophyll and its value is 0.3 mg/m3. This method results in a total of 250 particles being drawn by introducing biases to the background field. Another important step in the Particle Filter technique is the selection of strong particles to represent Posterior PDF. This is done using a sequential importance resampling (SIR) method (van Leeuwen 2009, Bhowmick et al., 2019, Bhowmick et. al. 2023) to ensure robust estimation of the posterior distribution. The basic idea is to discard particles with low weights and retain multiple copies of particles with relatively higher weights, keeping the total number of particles the same. Selection of particles based on its weight is carried out using Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) method. In this method, weights are first normalised
