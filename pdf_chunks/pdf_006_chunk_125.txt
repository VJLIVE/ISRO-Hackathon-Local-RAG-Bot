Its accuracy has been tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared from other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps of MODIS data. 2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as Himalayas (Kulkarni et. al. 2006). 3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 ÔÅ≠m with 1 km spatial resolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km resolution. 4) The algorithm will be further improved using NDVI and brightness temperature to identify snow under forest and cloud, respectively. In addition, Spectral range of band 1 of INSAT 3 D and AWiFS band 2 are different, threshold values needs to be Snow cover INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 105 evaluated. This will be initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of Space Applications Centre and then sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D data. 5) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly
