high gradient of wind fields (e.g. tropical cyclones) and found to produce satisfactory results. The gridded wind fields are computed in near real time with a delay of 24 hours for daily winds and 12hours for 12hourly winds. Every product also contains a log file for the quality of analysed wind products. Sometimes, swath data are not available due to unforeseen circumstances, even then analysed fields are generated which contains wider gaps or larger spatial interpolation. In such cases, analysed winds may not be of good quality and it is mentioned in the Log file. This version is a test dataset to provide insight for near real time generation of high spatial and temporal resolutions at later stage. The data are available at MOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in/) and can be freely distributed (Contact persons: rksharma@sac.isro.gov.in and abhisek1984@sac.isro.gov.in ). The data files are in BINARY (GrADS) format. Acknowledgements The ASCAT level2B data used for these products are made available by EUMETSAT through EUMETCAST. The sample GIF images are produced through GrADS Software. The processing software for this analysed wind product is developed within the ISRO under OSCAT utilization project.
