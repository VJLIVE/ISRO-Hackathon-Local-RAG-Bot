histogram analysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by computing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the mid-infrared images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:    i j I j i I a ) , ( (1) Where  j i I , represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). 14.4.1.1.4 Height assignment The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: Infrared Window Channel (WIN): In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds.
