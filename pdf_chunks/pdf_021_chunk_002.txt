of surface measurements with H-E is more stable than with 3B42 V7. In daily 0.25ox0.25o grid, the correlation and rms difference over land between surface observations and H-E is 0.47 and 25.40 mm/day. A slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and lowered rms difference of 22.40 is observed between H-E and 3B42 V7. These comparison statistics are in agreement with comparison of surface observations with 3B42 V7. The similar comparisons over oceans are conducted between H-E and 3B42 V7, which show a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h. The advantage of H-E over 3B42 V7 is its near real time dissemination. Report provides details of the study. 10. Classification: Unrestricted 11.

Rain gauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of the precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of the rain gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of various rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, etc. On the other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their coverage is limited due to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to poor calibration of radar reflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based observation network often fail to work. In view of the limitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large
