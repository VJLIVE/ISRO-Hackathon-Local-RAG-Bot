0 – 25 m s-1, Possible Flag values: 0: good retrievals with ranges specified above, 1: one or more Tbs out-of range; All GPs set to -99.99, 2: Surface type not oceanic; All GPs set to -99.99, 3: Rain present; All GPs set to -99.99, 4: CLW > 50 mg cm-2; TPW and WS set to -99.99, 5: CLW > 18 mg cm-2; WS set to -99.99, 6: One of the GPs exceeding valid range and set to - 99.99 3.8 Validation A separate ATBD for validation is submitted. However, the limited validation (in collaboration with validation team) for fine tuning of the retrieval algorithm will be carried out and the details of which are presented below. 3.8.1 Data required  Measurement of GPs from other satellites  Surface insitu measurements over global oceans. 3.8.2 Method of validation  Collocated pointwise comparison statistics to be generated.  Histogram of GPs over given area and season to be compared.  Variability and Trends to be studied. 3.9 Technical issues: In this document we have provided the details of the various components of the retrieval algorithm for deriving the cloud liquid water, wind speed and integrated water vapor over oceans using MT-MADRAS channels. We hope to achieve the accuracies as provided for SSM/I. In view of our past experience of deriving the same parameters using MSMR observation, we do not foresee any practical difficulty in deriving the same using MT-MADRAS. The derived parameters need Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 40 to be validated extensively over different regions and seasons of the year so that complete dynamic range of the parameters could be validated. We expect a separate team will be looking for the validation aspect. We, however, need their feedback for fine tuning the retrieval algorithms in the post launch phase. 3.10 Future
