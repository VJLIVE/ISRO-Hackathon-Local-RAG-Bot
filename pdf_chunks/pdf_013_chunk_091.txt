by using daytime average of OLR obtained from half-hourly geostationary satellite observations. The rationale behind using the daytime OLR as against daily (24-hr average OLR) is that the daily averaged SWR is affected solely by the presence of day-time clouds, and therefore the algorithm performs better than that used in SH98. The empirical relationship developed by Shahi et al [2010], however, was developed for a single buoy location, and is not valid over other locations, particularly over different latitude regions. Shahi et al. [2011] further improved the algorithm to make it valid over a wide Indian Ocean region by including the solar zenith angle in the empirical formulations. The detailed formulation is given in the following section. 6.4. Formulation of the SWR Algorithm The improved algorithm developed at Space Applications Centre (SAC) to compute the SWR from OLR observations from geostationary satellites is described in detail by Shahi et al. [2011]. The methodology was developed using a large collocated dataset of the spatially well distributed (in latitude) buoy measured SWR and the half-hourly estimates of OLR from geostationary satellite observations over Indian Ocean region. The generalization of the empirical relationship has been achieved by normalizing the SWR values to nadir locations by making use of the solar zenith angle information. The in-situ SWR is the down-welling shortwave radiation measured by the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy. Daily average shortwave radiation is computed as a 24 hour average. Fig.1 shows the locations of the 13 RAMA buoys in the warm pool region of Indian Ocean used for the algorithm development for the period of 2002-2009. The OLR products have been obtained from EUMETSAT for the Indian Ocean coverage of the Meteosat-5 (sub-satellite point at 57°E) upto December 2006 and Meteosat-7 (sub- satellite point at 63°E)
