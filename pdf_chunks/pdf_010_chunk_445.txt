Wind shear data from aircrafts may also give some data for validating dry microburst index. 4.6.1 Data Required Doppler weather radar observations of dry micro burst events may be useful in validation. Wind data during aircraft landing may also give some indication of dry microburst events whenever they occur which may also be used for validation. 4.6.2 Methods of Validation Conventional/direct comparison of computed and observed quantities. 4.7 Technical Issues (Limitation etc.) As the index is based on observations over USA where Great Plains with a very dry air exists, applicability over Indian region may require slight modifications. For instance more emphasis may be given to study of meteorological conditions leading to dust storms, etc. and development of suitable indices. As the sounder gives vertical profiles of temperature and humidity only over cloud free regions, one may not be able to detect such events from sounder retrievals. 4.8 References Meteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole, 502 pp. Pryor, K.L., Ellrod, G.P., and A.A., Bailey, 2002: Convective downburst potential using GOES sounder derived products.
