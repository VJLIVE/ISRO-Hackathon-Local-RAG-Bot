Quantitative assessment of the CMV product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be Parameter Lat. Lon.
