out for only synoptic hours. For validation at specific time-period special launch campaign will be carried out where high quality radiosondes are launched and these soundings would be used with radiative transfer model for CSBT validation. Apart from this inter-satellite comparison will be carried out using CSBT products from hyperspectral sounder observation collocated with INSAT-3D/3DR Sounder and convolving with the SRFs.

Background The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud properties such as cloud top temperature, cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount from two INSAT-3D thermal infrared window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5-12.5 m) and water vapor (6.7 m) channels. This document also describes the validation procedure. In this document some background and the methodology employed to derive the cloud top temperature/pressure and effective cloud amount is discussed. It mainly discusses the theoretical basis and practical aspects of the retrieval algorithm for cloud parameters from INSAT-3D imager channels and outlines the intended validation approach with validation results. The cloud properties such as cloud cover, cloud height etc. are very important for various climate and weather applications. The clouds at different heights affects weather and climate
