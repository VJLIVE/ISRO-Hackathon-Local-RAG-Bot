The coefficients Bi are harmonic components with Pi and Qi coefficients expressed as functions of polarization p and LQFLGHQFH DQJOH  DW D JLYHQ radar operating frequency and Nh is the number of harmonics considered. As, so far, the observed dependency of radar backscatter on wind conditions has not been well- explained theoretically, the empirical relationships are established using simultaneous measurements of radar backscatter and ocean surface wind vector obtained through model analysis as well as insitu measurements. The Geophysical Model Function (GMF) is an empirical relationship between radar backscatter and wind vector. In equation (1), the non harmonic component (or the constant term) signifies the base value of variation of radar backscatter for a given wind speed, incidence angle and polarization, the first harmonic represents the upwind-downwind ratio of backscatter while second harmonic which is dominant among all other harmonics signifies the upwind-crosswind ratio. Though the third harmonic representing the skewness around cross wind direction is very small in value but along with the first harmonic, it is very important for the wind direction retrieval. 4.1 Prevailing GMF: There are various GMFs available for Ku-band known as SASS-1, SASS-2, NSCAT-1, NSCAT-2, and QSCAT-1. The functional forms of these GMFs are given by Schroeder et al, (1982); Wentz, (1994); Wentz and Smith (1999) and Dunbar (1999). As an example of the difference among GMFs, the variation of horizontal polarization radar backscatter from NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs at different wind speeds is depicted in figure (3). 7 (a) 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 Relative wind direction (degree) -45 -40 -35 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 Sigma-0 (dB) WS=2 m/s WS=8 m/s WS=14 m/s WS=20 m/s (b) 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270
