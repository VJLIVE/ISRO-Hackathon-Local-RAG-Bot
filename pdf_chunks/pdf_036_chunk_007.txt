between Auxiliary Data for O/I/GDR Products GDR products, unlike OGDR and IGDR products, are fully validated products. 1.1.1. Product contents The Level-2 products from this mission comprise a family of nine different types of geophysical data records (GDRs). As illustrated in Table 1 below, there are three families of GDRs, distinguished by increasing latency and accuracy, going from the Operational GDR (OGDR), to the Interim GDR (IGDR), to the final GDR. Within each of these three families there are up to three types of files in NetCDF format, with increasing size and complexity: 1. a reduced 1 Hz subset of the full dataset in NetCDF format (O/I/GDR-SSHA); SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 2 2. the native NetCDF formatted datasets (O/I/GDRs) which contain 1Hz records as well as 20 Hz high-rate values; 3. an expert sensor product containing the full radar-echo waveforms in NetCDF format (S- IGDR/S-GDR, not applicable to the OGDR). Table 1. Summary of operational, interim, and final geophysical data record products (O/I/GDR) from the SARAL/AltiKa mission. All nine files contain sea surface height, ocean surface wind speed, significant wave height information and all required corrections. The NetCDF files differ in the amount and type of auxiliary data included but the product format is the same. 1.1.2. Filename conventions The product names are based on the following convention: With : <O/I/G> : product family (O : OGDR, I : IGDR, G: GDR) <N/R/S> : product type (N : native, R: reduced, S : sensor) <v> : product version (set to ‘T’ during CalVal phases, then set to the current altimetric version from data standards) <S/P> : product duration (S : segment for OGDR, P : pass for I/GDR) <ccc>: cycle number of 1st product record <pppp> : pass number of 1st product record
