The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo always remained high as compared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After that, estimated ETo underestimated measured ETo. In January, both showed low values in the range of 30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm (estimated) in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 mm over ten days (16.6% deviation from AMS mean). The typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented here by Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and February. The data over monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for computation of ETo. In this part of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well captured by dekadal ETo variation during stated months. During July, ETo remained higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ETo showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to AMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD of 6.3 mm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo. The southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural scrub vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used for comparison with AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The difference
