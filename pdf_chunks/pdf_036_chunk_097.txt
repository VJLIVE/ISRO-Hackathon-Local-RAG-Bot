of the variable(s) (quality flag) representing the quality of the current variable scale_factor If present, the data are to be multiplied by this factor after the data are read by an application. See also add_offset attribute source Data source (model features, or observation) standard_name A standard name that references a description of a variables content in the standard name table tai_tuc_difference Difference between TAI and UTC reference time units Unit of a variable’s content. The value of this attribute must be a string that can be recognized by the UNIDATA’s Udunits package valid_max Largest theoretical valid value of a variable (this is not the maximum of actual data) valid_min Smallest theoretical valid value of a variable (this is not the minimum of actual data) Table 17 - Variable’s attributes 6.1.3. The Common Data Language The Common Data Language (CDL) is used to describe the content of a data set. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 65 The CDL is textual notation that described the netCDF object and it is human readable. The netCDF utility ncdump converts netCDF objects binary to CDL text. The netCDF utility ncgen creates netCDF binary file from CDL text file. A CDL description of a netCDF data set takes the form: netCDF name { dimension: … variables: … data: … } where the name is used only as a default in constructing file names by the ncgen utility. The CDL description consists of three optional parts, introduced by the keywords dimensions variables and data. NetCDF dimension declarations appear after the dimensions keyword, netCDF variables and attributes are defined after the variables keyword and variable data assignments appears after the data keyword. CDL statement are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs and newlines can be used freely for readability. Comments in CDL
