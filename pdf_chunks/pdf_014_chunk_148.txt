channel data covers only high-level i.e. from 100-500 hPa, while iii) visible and mid-infrared channel data covers low-levels i.e. from 600-950 hPa respectively. 5-Day INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 131 composite winds maps derived using the retrieved AMVs in three broad atmospheric levels are very useful for monitoring of monsoon flows over Indian region. The following Fig-1 shows an example of weekly low-level monsoon flow for the weeks viz. 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July 2017 respectively. Figure-1: Low-level (701 - 950 hPa) weekly monsoon flow derived using visible AMVs for the weeks 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July 2017 respectively. This type of 5-day composite wind map derived from AMVs can be used to monitor the progress of monsoon on operational basis. 12.4. Objective The main objective of this study is to discuss the procedure for deriving the 5-day composite wind maps derived using atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) retrieved from INSAT-3D/3DR over land and sea at every half-hour interval. The region over which these products will be retrieved is same as the domain where AMVs are retrieved i.e. in the region 30-130E, 50S-50N. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 132 12.5.
