Band 2) Pixels that are approximately 25 % or greater covered by snow have been found to have NDSI values 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et. al., 2006). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water from snow. Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 121 These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et. al. 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006). In forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly classify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (negi et. al., 2006; Hall et al, 1998). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the NDSI are used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance in other land covers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be generated using AWiFS sensor. The NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values observed in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested pixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, yet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions
