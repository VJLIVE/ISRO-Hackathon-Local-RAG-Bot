temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period. Step: 5 Sub-Grid Scale Rainfall: In order to produce precipitation estimates at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, it is necessary to develop an improved method. Sub â€“grid scale is possible with help of recent developments at NOAA/NESDIS. However, the GPI algorithm will also be attempted to provide at 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grids by some alternative approach. Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, moving average, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. Step: 6 Validations: Regarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR (at present four at Chennai, SHAR, Kolkatta, Machliputtnam and some more are planned by IMD) and Surface Rain Gauges (SFRG) Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly desirable in and around the maximum validation sites in temporal window of every hour. Remarks: During the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided with a flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when more than 50% of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or Monthly scale average rainfall estimates.

The theoretical basis is that 1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. 2. Clouds
