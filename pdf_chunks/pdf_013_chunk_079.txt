hourly interval upto 72 hours. In this algorithm only temperature at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of Rn. Parameters Source Operational hourly forecast output from WRF at 0.05° x 0.05° spatial resolution for the following parameters in ASCII format (latitude, longitude, parameter) a) Air temperature (K) at 2 m height MOSDAC 5.4. Algorithm functional specifications 5.4.1. Clear sky net surface radiation (Rnclr) Three hourly clear sky day time net radiation over land will estimated using land surface temperature, albedo and surface insolation. Rnclr will estimated as function of net shortwave (Rnsclr) and net longwave (Rnlclr) : nlclr nsclr nclr R R R   (1) Rnsclr will be function of instanteous incoming shortwave (Rsiclr) and albedo (α) and in this algorithm the incoming shortwave radiation will be taken from already developed and operationalized INSAT-3D product. Whereas, albedo will be taken from the proposed land albedo product from INSAT data. Rnsclr will be computed only for day-time. siclr nsclr R R ) 1(    (2) Now net longwave radiation (Rnlclr) will be function of incoming (Rliclr) and outgoing (Rloclr) longwave radiation loclr liclr nlclr R R R   (3) Rliclr is a defined as 4 i a liclr T R    (4) Where, Ɛa = Air emissivity, σ= Stefan Blotzmann constant & Ti = Air temperature Ɛa will be estimated using air emissivity (Bastiaanssen et al, 1998) and defined as INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 69 09 .0 ln 85 .0 sw a T    (5) Where, Tsw = Atmospheric Transmissivity Tsw will be derived from the ratio of incoming shortwave radiation (Rsi) to extra-terrestrial radiation (Rext). The extra-terrestrial radiation will be computed using astronomical units for INSAT pixel for each instanteous acquisition. The air temperature (Ti) will be
