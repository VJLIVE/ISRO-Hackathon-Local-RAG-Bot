the quantitative estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are quite successful but suffer from a scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. Theoretical and empirical studies addressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical assessment continues to appear. A definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because of the complex and variable microphysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis-Ã -vis coarser resolution of microwave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the rainfall data from the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several algorithms have been developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall used here is based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width of about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by NASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is most plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation of rain estimates from IR measurements. Following the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, that combines mul- tispectral measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the present algorithm, IMSRA is thus proposed in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses cloud-top temperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995; Vicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and Gutman 1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; Vicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining
