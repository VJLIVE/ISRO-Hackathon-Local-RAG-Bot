(9) Equation (8) is the basic equation for the problem of radiative transfer in the plane-parallel atmosphere, which is extremely difficult to solve. Part of difficulty is due to the azimuthal dependence of I through the phase function. By expanding Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 14 the phase function in a Legendre polynomial series, the azimuthally dependent terms in the function can be uncoupled. Only the azimuthally independent equation contributes to the flux calculations, which is of greatest interest in most atmospheric applications. Thus confining our solution for the azimuthally independent equation. Radiative transfer models: The following two radiative transfer models are being used at SAC for simulations and sensitivity studies. 1. Eddington approximations In Eddington approximation it is assumed that for an isotropic field the ratio of the second moment of the radiation field to the mean intensity is everywhere equal to 1/3. In the plane parallel Eddington approximation, radiances are expanded in a series of Legendre and associated Legendre functions: ..... θ cos )z( I )z ( I ) φ ,θ , τ( I 1 0 ν ν    (10) and the phase function is similarly expanded in Legendre polynomials .......... θ cos ω 1 ) θ (cos P ω ) θ (cos P 0 1 N 0 l 0 l l 0      (11) where 0 θ is the angle from ’, ’ to , , and the source function J(z, , ) can be written as ] θ cos )z ( I)z( g )z( I )[ z ( ω )z( T )] z ( ω 1[ ) φ ,θ ,z( J 1 0 ν     (12) where the asymmetry factor is given by 3 ω g 1  . Using this expression the isotropic component of the diffuse
