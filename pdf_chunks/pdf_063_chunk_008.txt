products generated using single day of data has the corresponding day in the file name. The file name also conveys parameter, category and sub-category of the product. The convention is described below:  For NorthPolar24 and SouthPolar24 products: S1L4PL_yyyyddd_AAA_CC_V_R.tif  For India, NorthPolar72, SouthPolar72 and Global products: S1L4PL_yyyyddd_yyyyddd _AAA_CC_V_R.tif where S1 = product of SCATSAT1 L4 = product of level 4 P = S/B/G for product of sigma0/brightness temperature/gamma0 L = H/V for HH/VV polarization yyyyddd = Acquisition start and end date in year and Julian day. AAA =ASC/DES/BTH corresponding to ascending/descending/both passes CC = IN/NP/SP/GL2/GL625 for INDIA/NPOLAR/SPOLAR/GLOBAL category 6 V = Version number of L1B product used as input (e.g., v1.1.2) R = Version of L4 product generation algorithm (e.g., 1.1) Following table shows example file names for all categories of sigma0 products having end date of 28th September 2016. For 24 hrs products, the start and end acquisition time are start and end acquisition time of first and last revolution of Julian day mentioned by the filename. For a product spanning more than 24 hrs, start acquisition time is acquisition start time of first revolution of first Julian day and end acquisition time is acquisition end time of last revolution of second Julian day.
