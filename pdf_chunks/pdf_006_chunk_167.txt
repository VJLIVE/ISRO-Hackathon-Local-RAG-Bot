the present study are listed as: (i) It is assumed that an adequate knowledge of the background temperature prevailing in India in all season and geographic regions are known and correct. (ii) False fire alarm will be mostly controlled. However, fine tuning in first year of operation may be required. Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 138 (iii) Fire pixel flagged and will represent approximate locations of fire an do not represent the actual fire size. (iv) Fires below threshold (Small cool fires) and those burning below thick overgrowth may go undetected. 8.8 Future Scope Further tuning of thresholds by inclusion of more training datasets. 8.9 References 1.
