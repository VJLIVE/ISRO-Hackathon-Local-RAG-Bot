INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are used to derive AMVs over the Indian Ocean region and operational retrieval algorithm is described in Deb et al. 2016. In the present document, a new staggering algorithm is discussed where data from infrared (i.e. TIR1) and water vapor (i.e. WV) channels of both the satellites are used simultaneously for higher temporal scale retrieval. Although the major steps of retrieval algorithm (i.e. Tracer Parameter Res. Accuracy Source Registered radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of split window TIR1 channel (10.5-11.5 μm) and WV channel (6.7μm) (All the data is required in fixed lat- lon grid for continuous 8-images separated by 30 minutes time interval for each satellite) L1C- Sector generated images over common area. It is assumed here that all input images (both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR) are well registered. pixel -- Derived from raw data by DP (data rocessing) Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - 0.3 K Derived by DP Geo-location file Pixel 4 km Derived by DP INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 153 selection, height assignment, tracking and quality control etc) staggering algorithm is same as present operational algorithm, however a few changes incorporated in the new algorithm to minimize the inaccuracies due to two separate satellite platform is shown in the following Figure -1. Figure 1: The flowcharts of staggering AMVs retrieval algorithm using INSAT-3D/3DR data At first, the satellite ID from which first input image is coming is checked, if it is from INSAT- 3DR, then second image from INSAT-3D is read. In the first image possible cloud tracers are identified and each selected tracer is represented by a box of 32 x 32 pixel. The tracer box in the first image (i.e. INSAT-3DR) is calibrated with respect to the collocated box in second image (i.e. INSAT-3D) using the
