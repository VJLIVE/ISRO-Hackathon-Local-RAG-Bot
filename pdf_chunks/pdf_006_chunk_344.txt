for nighttime fog detection Fog TB > TB min Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 276 Day Time Fog Detection The basis of the algorithm is a gross cloud check. This test is based on the assumption that the brightness temperature of high clouds are very low (<270 0K) and the brightness temperature of fog lies between that of land (very high brightness temperature) and high clouds during day time. The high cloud regions are eliminated by using a threshold of brightness temperature of 10.8 m channel. This threshold is determined dynamically. Once the region is classified as foggy, the day time detection algorithm is used. The day time algorithm of fog detection is based on the temporal differencing technique (Paul d’Entremont and Gustafson, 2003) which is used operationally to monitor cloud using geostationary data. In this method apart from using thermal channel like TIR1 channel of INSAT-3D for cloud detection, the visible channel (0.55-0.75 m) is also used. The droplet size of fog being close to the wavelength of visible and infrared radiation, fog has prominent scattering effect. Thus the visible channel plays an important role in detecting day time fog. 17.4.1.2 Flow chart for day time fog detection Gross Cloud Check Not a Cloud Cloud Generation of cloud free image using past 10/15 day data Cloudy/Foggy Data Temporal Differencing Technique Surface Elevation test Fog/ Low Stratus Elimination of snow pixel Imager Data Coversion from DN to Reflectance/ BT Homogeneity Test 17.4.2 Operational Implementation Night Time Fog Detection 17.4.2.1 Selection of night time data only by using information of solar zenith angle and visible count 17.4.2.2 Conversion of grey count to brightness temperature Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 277 17.4.2.3 Gross cloud testing using 10.8 μm brightness temperature 17.4.2.4 High cloud elimination by using
