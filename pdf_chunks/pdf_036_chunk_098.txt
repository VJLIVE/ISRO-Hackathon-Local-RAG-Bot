variables and data. NetCDF dimension declarations appear after the dimensions keyword, netCDF variables and attributes are defined after the variables keyword and variable data assignments appears after the data keyword. CDL statement are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs and newlines can be used freely for readability. Comments in CDL follow the characters ‘//’ on any line. Example netcdf example { dimensions: time = 3213 ; // dimensions name are declared first meas_ind = 40 ; variables: double time(time) ; // variable <type> <name>(<dimension>) time:long_name = "time (sec. since 2000-01-01)" ; // variable attributes time:standard_name = "time" ; time:calendar = "gregorian" ; time:tai_utc_difference = -34. ; time:leap_second = "0000-00-00 00:00:00" ; time:units = "seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0" ; time:comment = "[tai_utc_difference] is the difference between TAI and UTC reference time (seconds) for the first measurement of the data set.
