Collocation criteria for each parameter: Spatial Temporal (hr) 1 ˚ 2 ˚ 3˚ 0.5 water vapor profiles water vapor profiles Temperature & water vapor profiles 1 water vapor profiles water vapor profiles --------DO-------- 2 water vapor profiles water vapor profiles ------ DO------- The validation results will be expressed in terms of arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the difference of parameter at each level using the formulae: Mean deviation at each pressure/height level, ) (l X  =      ) ( 1 ) , ( ) , ( ) ( 1 l M i True Test l i X l i X l M And its standard deviation at each pressure/height level, Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 77   ) (l X      ) ( 1 2 )) , ( ) , ( ( 1 ) ( 1 l M i True Test l i X l i X l M Where, l is the pressure level, i the collocation pair index and ) (l M is the number of collocation pairs at level l 6.6 Technical Issues:  Radio occultation measurements are over a location of the earth depending on the position of GPS and LEO satellites. The exact location over which radio occultation measurements are possible, require prior knowledge of GPS and Megha-Tropiques orbit. One may expect 500 to 800 occultations per day spread in the domain (30S-30N; 180W-180E) with dense occurrence around
