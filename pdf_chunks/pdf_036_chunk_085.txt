are all related to luni-solar forcing of the earth, either directly as is the case of the ocean and solid earth tide, or indirectly as is the case with the load tide since it is forced by the ocean tide. The pole tide is due to variations in the earthâ€™s rotation and is unrelated to luni-solar forcing. SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs do not explicitly provide values for the pure ocean tide, but instead provide values for a quantity referred to as the geocentric ocean tide, which is the sum total of the ocean tide and the load tide. Values of the load tide that were used to compute the geocentric ocean tide are also explicitly provided, so the pure ocean tide can be determined by subtracting the load tide value from the geocentric ocean tide value. Note that the permanent tide is not included in either the geocentric ocean tide or solid earth tide corrections that are provided on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs. 5.9.1. Geocentric Ocean Tide As mentioned above, the geocentric ocean tide is a quantity sometimes used to refer to the sum total of the ocean tide and the load tide. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides two choices for the geocentric ocean tide, ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2, each of which is computed as the sum total of the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tides as predicted by a particular model, and an equilibrium representation of the long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero frequency (constant) term. The two load tide values provided on the GDR, load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2, provide the respective load tide values that were used to compute ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2. 5.9.2. Long period Ocean Tide The long-period ocean tides are a subject of continuing investigation. To first order, they can be approximated by an equilibrium representation. However,
