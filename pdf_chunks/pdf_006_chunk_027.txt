Since narrow field-of-view (NFOV) radiometers on-board satellites, such as CERES, measure the upwelling radiance only in specific outgoing directions from a scene on Earth at any given time, OLR cannot be measured instantaneously. Given a radiance field, L(θ, Φ) , at the TOA, where θ is the satellite viewing zenith angle, and Φ the azimuth angle, the OLR leaving the earth-atmosphere system, is obtained by integrating the radiance field over the solid angle ω of the upper hemisphere: 2 2 0 0 OLR L( , ) cos sin d d        (1) 100 m 4 m L( , ) L ( , )d         (2) For an isotropic radiance field, the radiance to OLR conversion is simple (OLR=πL). Unfortunately, the radiance field L(θ, Φ) is not isotropic and an accurate portraying of the anisotropy is needed to estimate the OLR from the radiance measurement. The anisotropic emission factor (AEF) R(θ, Φ ) is defined as the ratio of the equivalent Lambertian OLR to the actual OLR (Loeb et al., 2003). L( , ) R( , ) OLR    (3) Eq. (3) is widely used to infer the OLR from the radiance measurement L(θ, Φ ) available from the broadband (4 µm – 100 µm ) radiometers (e.g CERES, ScaRab, ERBE, etc) As mentioned above, the OLR is obtained by integrating the radiances over the long-wave spectral range and over hemispheric solid angles.
