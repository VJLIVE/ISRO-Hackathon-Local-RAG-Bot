theoretical basis for the individual algorithms of various geophysical parameters except HSCAS and tropical cyclone. Algorithms for tropical cyclone position and intensity estimation system and snow analysis system are to be written jointly with IMD because derivation of these parameters needs large number of auxillary inputs and operational meterological expertise. Discussion is going on with IMD for making these two algorithms. The purpose of this document is to describe the scientific algorithms which will be used to extract the Meteorological Products from the pre-processed Level 1 image data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) and 19 channel Sounder onboard INSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra- red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6μm, NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm, IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm. Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the following Table-1 Table – 1: INSAT-3D VHRR Specification Channel No Wavelength (m) Resolution (Km) 1 2 3 4 0.55 - 0.75 1.55 - 1.70 3.8 - 4.0 6.5 - 7.1 1 1 4 8 5 10.2 - 11.3 4 6 11.5 - 12.5 4 INSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection during daytime. Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise sensitivity are summarized in the Table-2.
