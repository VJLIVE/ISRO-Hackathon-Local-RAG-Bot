Where Wki is a wind speed derived from ith measurement σ0M(φi, θi, pi) while Wk is a best (but with errors) wind speed to which all measurements are associated with. In this recent approach, a given backscatter observation σ0M(φi, θi, pi) is converted into wind speed Wki for an assumed wind direction through GMF as Wki = Wj such that σ0M(φi, θi, pi) = σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi) 6 Here, Wj is varied over the range specified by GMF being used and Wki is obtained numerically through linear interpolation of σ0G and Wj (due to its closure form and hence efficient). The derived wind speed Wki is a sum of true speed WTk and an error WEki which is a manifestation of errors in backscatter. The true error in σ0M is unknown but is represented by variance of σ0M (communication noise) defined in terms of Kp value which can be calculated using model backscatter (GMF) and the sensor parameters α, β and γ (Fischer, 1972; Long and Mendel, 1991; Oliphant and Long, 1999) as Kpi = √((γi / σ0G i 2) + (βi / σ0G i) +α i } 7 Thus assuming WEki = Kpi.WTk, the Wki can be redefined considering the backscatter variance as Wki = WTk(1+ Kpi) 8 15 Using M number of σ0M measurements, the backscatter variance-weighted mean of derived wind speed for trial wind direction χK is defined as Wk = Σ M i=1{Wki /(1+Kpi)} / Σ M i=1{1 /(1+Kpi)} 9 Since Wki is calculated assuming σ0G = σ0M, the Kpi value cannot be calculated from σ0M. For this reason, all Kpi values are first initialized to zero, and then Wki and corresponding Kpi are calculated through GMF using equations (4) and (2), respectively. The Wk is recalculated using the updated values of Kpi, and the
