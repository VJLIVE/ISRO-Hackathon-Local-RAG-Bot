especially the SWIR channels, which is crucial for aerosol retrieval. Most of the spaceborne optical imaging sensors onboard different Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites such as OceanSat (1, 2 and upcoming 3), CARTOSAT (1, 2 and 3) and RESOURCESAT (1 and 2), etc. were designed for specific applications related to Earth surface (land and ocean) monitoring and mapping, as in various EOS missions, and were not designed to accommodate channels for aerosol studies. For this reason, the existing AOD retrieval techniques requiring SWIR and visible channels, in multiple wavelengths, cannot be used for Aerosol retrieval from any of the ISRO sensors’ data. INSAT-3D/3DR is the only exception, where utilizing the advantage of fixed view geometry due to Geostationary platform, a basic AOD product using single visible channel data without the need of SWIR measurement is operationally generated and is available for public use, on the SAC/VEDAS site (Mishra et al., 2018). However, this method is not so efficient or accurate and is not suited to good accuracy aerosol retrieval, which limits its use to qualitative estimate purpose, and time-series change monitoring only. The reason for less research work toward the development of aerosol retrieval algorithm for single-view visible to near-infrared (VNIR) sensor in past may be due to significant aerosol contamination in the entire VNIR spectral range that makes surface characterization a difficult problem. Moreover, since electromagnetic radiation of SWIR (2µm) wavelength minimally interact 10 with aerosols therefore researchers found MODIS-like sensors more feasible for developing relatively simpler aerosol retrieval algorithm. Thus, due to the impracticality of implementation of existing AOD retrieval methods to ISRO’s operational satellites’ data, routine accurate AOD retrieval could not be done. However, extremely poor air quality over Indian landmass, especially the urban centers, and the high priority requirement from Environment Ministries, for high resolution (sub
