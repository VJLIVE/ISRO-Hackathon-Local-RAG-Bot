field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et al. 2006). These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et al, 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et al. 2006). Since bandwidth of AWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D(R) imager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be established using Field Spectral Data INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 19 Library of Space Applications Centre (Singh et al. 2005 and Negi et al. 2006). This will be further evaluated during post launch period, by carrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et al. 2006). In forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly classify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et al. 2006). NDVI and NDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance for other land covers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D(R) payload, mask will be used from other existing source. Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water from snow. 1.4.2.3. Snow / Cloud Discrimination Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their generally high reflectance
