pixel and ambient background pixels in a linear form (Wooster et al., 2003). The proposed method is based on the assumption that Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) channel. Biomass burning emission will be computed using eq.2 (Wooster, 2002) below: E = ∫  FRPdt x ß x F β is biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) which is assumed to be a constant. It is 0.368 ±0.015 kg/MJ based on field controlled experiments regardless of the land surface conditions (Wooster et al., 2005). This coefficient has been accepted for the calculation of biomass burning emissions from MODIS FRP, SEVERI FRP and GOES FRP (Roberts et al., 2009; Ellicott et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2012), and so this value will be adopted. F is emission factor (a representative value that is used to represent the quantity of a trace gas or aerosol species released into the atmosphere during a forest fire activity. The value is a function of fuel type and is expressed as the number of kilograms of particulate per ton (or metric ton) of material or fuel. The value for F will be assigned for each emitted species (CO and PM2.5) with land cover type according to values published in literature (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Wiedinmyer et al., 2006). Specifically, the emission factors will be assigned to stratified land cover types: e.g. 11.07 g/kg (PM2.5) and 77 g/kg (CO) in forests, 5.6 g/kg (PM2.5) and 84 g/kg (CO) in shrublands, 9.5 g/kg (PM2.5) and 90 g/kg (CO) in grasslands, and 5.7 g/kg (PM2.5) and 70 g/kg (CO) in croplands. Although INSAT-3D/R satellites observe the surface every 15–30 min, observations of diurnal fires may, to a great extent, be obstructed
