It is needed as an input to a variety of climatic, ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical studies. Retrieval of LST from the Earth observation satellite is quite challenging since the land surface is laterally inhomogeneous and is composed of various materials with different geometries. Surface temperatures are derived from satellite based measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR) window channels using either empirical method or physical algorithm. A number of Earth observation satellites such as EOS-MODIS, ASTER, AATSR,
