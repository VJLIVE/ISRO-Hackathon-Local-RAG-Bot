the independent testing dataset. SAC-Algorithm [Shahi et al., 2011] o used the normalized SWR w.r.t. the nadir viewing angle, i.e. SWR sec2(), in the empirical formulation, where  is solar zenith angle at local noon. The polynomial least square equation between normalized SWR and OLR was found to be: (SWR) sec2() = -0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) – 220.75 which provides the final expression for computing the SWR as: SWR = cos2() [-0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) – 220.75] Figure 1: Locations of RAMA buoys in Indian Ocean overlaid on a sample Meteosat OLR coverage INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 81 The improved algorithm is referred as SAC-SWR Algorithm. The root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) computed for SAC-SWR estimates from the buoy observations was found to be ~28 W m-2 in the testing dataset in contrast to the ~39 W m-2 obtained using SH98. The SAC-SWR algorithm was also compared with other datasets for the year 2007 available from: (i) Global Energy and Water-Cycle Experiment Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB) project of NASA World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), (ii) International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Surface Radiative Flux Dataset (ISCCP-FD), and (iii) National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) analysis. The Spatial resolution of GEWEX-SRB, ISCCP-FD and NCEP SWR products are 1°, 2.8° and 1.875°, respectively. The RMSE computed for different SWR products from buoy SWR shows that RMSE for SAC-SWR is lowest for the entire range of SWR values, indicating that the accuracy of the SAC-SWR is best under all sky conditions followed closely by GEWEX-SWR. For combined dataset RMSE for SAC-SWR is 27.3 W m-2, which is the smallest, followed by 32.7, 37.5 and 59.6 W m-2, respectively, for GEWEX, ISCCP and NCEP SWR products. The estimate of the standard error on weekly time scales is much smaller than that on daily time
