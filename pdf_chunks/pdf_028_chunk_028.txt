(1991), who developed a global scattering index (SI) at 85 GHz for use with the SSM/I sensor. Further refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and Ferraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 22 best predict the 85 GHz Tb under "nonscattering" conditions for the land surface in question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, a measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could be determined. The form of the SI is as follows: SI85v = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v â€“ Tb85v where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set of SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive evaluation, Grody (1991) found that an SI value of 10 K or greater was a good, global indicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also causes the detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can cause a similar scattering signature, a set of "screens" were developed to remove such features. The desert check involves the use of polarization information at 19 GHz, while the separation of rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving the Tb at 22 and 85 GHz. Ferraro et al., (1994), built upon the Grody (1991) study, and developed a more robust set of relationships to be used for the detection of rain over land from the SSM/I. In this study, separate relationships were developed for land and ocean, improving the sensitivity to scattering. In addition, the original relationships derived by Grody (1991) used antenna temperatures which were convolved to the 19 GHz FOV; the updated study used the more conventional Tb values and preserved
