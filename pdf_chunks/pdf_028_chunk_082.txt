(7) and (10) and a boundary condition (usually taken to be a temperature boundary condition at ~60 km estimated from a climatology or an atmospheric model). What we get are the “dry” temperature and pressure, accurate to real temperature and pressure in the water vapor scarce Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 72 region obtained in the upper troposphere and beyond. The “dry” T has a cold bias in the lower troposphere below 230K as shown in figure 3. Figure 3. A depiction of cold bias in “dry” temperature below 10km Realistic temperature and pressure profile require inclusion of water vapor pressure (e) term in equation (7) and (10) for retrieval below 230K. This demarcation at 230K temperature is defined as the water vapor point (O’ Sullivan et al. 2000). The water vapor point is observed to vary in different latitude zones. For the tropics (30S-30N), the water vapor point at 230K is determined through a sensitivity study of the error statistics of retrieved T, P and e from refractivity, N to different choices of water vapor point (Shyam et al., 2009). In altitude terms, the water vapor point for the tropics range from 10-12km. Below this altitude, water vapor has a non-negligible concentration and contributes significantly to refractivity. Thus, the algorithm goes for a composite retrieval (to be called “Wet retrieval”) of all the three unknowns simultaneously. “Wet” Retrieval The algorithm approximates temperature, for the region below the “water vapor point (wvp)”, to be a quadratic function of the natural logarithm of atmospheric pressure. Between the estimated water vapor point and the surface (or, the lowest altitude at which a’ priori P and T are available), temperature is assumed to vary as a quadratic function of natural logarithm of P (denoted by σ) i.e. T (σ) = a + b*σ +
