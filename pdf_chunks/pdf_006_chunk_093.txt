and R (in mm h-1) at 210 K is shown in figure 1(a). The figures 1 (b) and 1(c) shows the relationship between R and Tb10.7 at different PW values for convective and non-convective cores, respectively. These figures are taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowaski et al. (2003). In H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is allowed to be combination of both convective and non-convective core. This is worked out by considering a pixel box of 101X101 pixels surrounding the pixel of interest. The minimum, mean and standard deviation of Tb10.7 (Tmin ), in this pixel box is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual region of interest. Within this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation () of Tbm10.7 is determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel is determined through the parameter Z, which is defined as: Z = (Tmean- Tb10.7)/  ----------(3) The maximum allowable value of Z is 1.5. If Z < 0; R = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective Otherwise, RR = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3) Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 74 Rc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW from Eta model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the pixel rain rate RR reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if Z=0, the pixel rain rate RR is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). In fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, and hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. Thus, this same computation of rain rate is performed for a
