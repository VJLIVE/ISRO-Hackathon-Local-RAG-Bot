Algorithm Functional Specifications 9.5.1. Overview The cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is intended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at coarser resolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at nominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir. The averaging over a Field of Regard (FOR) of 9x9 pixels is used to enhance the signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels is higher in comparison to clear pixels, therefore,
