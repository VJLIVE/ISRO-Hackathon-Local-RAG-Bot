Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water from snow. 1.4.2.3. Snow / Cloud Discrimination Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Kulkarni et al. 2002a), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of the spectrum. While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds have high reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold value and will be used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will further be improved due to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D(R) Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov and Tarpley, 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D(R) derived product. This will be additional criteria than in built criteria of NDSI. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 20 1.4.2.4. Flow Chart INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 21 1.4.2.5. Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold In order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, sensitivity tests of individual threshold values were carried out. Sensitivity analysis will be carry out to identify NDSI threshold for INSAT 3D(R) snow products. This threshold value will also be verified using FFC combination for snow covered area identification. 1.4.2.6. Fraction Snow Cover Snow binary product of INSAT
