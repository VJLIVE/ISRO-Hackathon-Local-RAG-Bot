LST products on diurnal scale This section presents results on the generation of LST products on the diurnal scale over India and surrounding region. Examples of the 3D-LST images are shown in the figure 12 for diurnal images acquired on Nov. 29, 2013. The 3D-LST images suggest that LST values were captured successfully, which ranged from 275-320 K over the Indian region for this particular day. 00:30 02:30 04:30 06:30 08:30 10:30 12:30 14:30 16:30 20:30 22:30 23:30 250 260 270 275 279 283 287 291 295 299 303 307 311 315 319 323 327 331 335 340 K No data Figure 12. Diurnal LST images generated using a split-window method from INSAT-3D Imager data over India for Nov. 29, 2013 As expected, higher temperatures during daytime were observed mostly in the western arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India as well as major portion of neighbouring countries having arid regions located in the west of India. While lower temperatures were observed in the northern parts of India, which are Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 298 were dominated by the winter crop regions. An analysis was carried out to obtain diurnal cycle of typical land covers in the LST profiles. The idea behind generation of LST on this scale is to check whether the model physics works well throughout the day or not. The diurnal patterns of LST over different land covers such as desert, shrub and crop are shown in the figure 13. The patterns resemble to the known behaviour of the LST on these land covers, which confirms that proposed SW method is working well over full day-night cycle. 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320 00:30 02:00 03:30 05:00 06:30 08:00 09:30 11:00 12:30 14:00 15:30
