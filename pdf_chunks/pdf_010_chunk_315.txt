B(T(i)) is the Planck function emission for layer ‘i’ at temperature T(i) and z(i) is layer-to-space transmittance from layer ‘i’ to space. s is surface emissivity and T(s) is surface temperature. Applying the polychromatic approximation, we convolve the layer-to-space transmittances and compute the radiances using above equation instead of convolving the monochromatic radiances. PLOD model relates the convolved layer-to-space transmittances to a simple function involving various profile dependent predictors. These predictors are functions of layer pressure, temperature, absorber amount, and viewing angle. Convolved transmittance is given by: ) 4 ( ) ln( 1         N i i i eff Q c  eff is the effective layer transmittance, Qi is the profile dependent predictor, and ci are the fast transmittance coefficients determined by linear regression of the above equation for a set of representative atmospheric profiles. PLOD model uses a regression on –ln(), i.e. the optical depth (k). A set of profiles is selected for calculation of the layer-to-space transmittances, which is used for regression in fast coefficient computation. These profiles represent the entire range of atmospheric variation, and should be weighted towards more typical cases. Computation of convolved layer-to-space transmittances is time consuming, thereby restricting the practical limit of number of profiles to be used in the regression. We use 49 regression profiles (6 zenith angles upto 62.5), which cover most of profile behavior in the INSAT-3D viewing region.
