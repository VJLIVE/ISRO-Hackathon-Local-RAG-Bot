Singh and Naveen Tripathi Snow Cover Mapping & Fractional Snow Cover 2.2. Introduction Algorithms is developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D(R) Meteorological payload. The snow mapping algorithm uses a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and to map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow mapping, as snow reflects strongly in the visible region but absorbs in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of the spectrum. The reflectance of clouds is high in the visible as well as short-wave IR. This characteristic is used to identify and map snow cover. Coarse resolution binary snow product from INSAT 3D imager will be further used to generate fractional snow cover product in synchronous with available high resolution snow cover products. Validation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data of Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS derived snow maps. The accuracy of the snow maps may vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snow map algorithm has been and will continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined from field measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the expected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 14 1.2.1. Overview and background The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on the ratio
