Introduction The purpose of this document is to present the methodology for deriving 5-day composite maps using Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D/3DR at different broad atmospheric levels. The out of six imager channels in INSAT-3D/3DR, AMVs are derived using four channels and they are: i) Visible (VIS) covering [0.55 –
