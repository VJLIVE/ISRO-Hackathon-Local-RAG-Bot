well the equation strings perform on a training set of the data is its fitness to the data, defined as sum of the squared differences between data and independent parameter derived from the equation string. The strongest individuals (equations with best fits) are then selected to exchange parts of the character strings between them (reproduction and crossover) while individuals less fitted to the data are discarded. Finally, a small percentage of the equation strings’ most basic elements, single operators and Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 38 variables, are mutated at random. The process is repeated a large number of times to improve the fitness of the evolving population of equations. The fitness strength of the best scoring equation is defined as: R2 = 1 – [2 /  (xo- <xo> )2] (7) where 2 =  (xc – xo)2, xc is parameter value estimated by the best scoring equation, xo is the corresponding “true” value, <xo> is the mean of the “true” values of x. Szpiro (1997) has shown the robustness of the genetic algorithm to forecast the behavior of one-dimensional chaotic dynamical system. 3.4.1.5 Flow Chart 3.4.2 Operational Implementation 3.4.2.1 Step 1 : Computation of the narrow band radiances from gray values 3.4.2.2 Step 2 : Computation of OLR from narrow band radiances 3.4.2.3 Step 3 : Merging of OLR with Geolocation files 3.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution OLR Wm-2 50 400 3 % pixel 3.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Lat, Lon, OLR, Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 35 E to 135 E INSAT-3D imager WV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 radiances Calculate zenith angle OLR retrieval OLR coefficients Geolocation file OLR Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 39 3.6 Validation 3.6.1 Data required The OLR computed by the
