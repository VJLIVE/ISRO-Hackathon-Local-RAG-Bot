to that of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean region (Deb et al., 2008). 13.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1). The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex number j i j i c j i v i u V , , ,   . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image- pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3
