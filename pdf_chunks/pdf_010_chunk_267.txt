cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. Cloud Base Method (BASE): Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy Mid infra-red wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 219 distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment
