(12) (13) ÔÅ§ = solar declination angle (radian) h = sun hour angle (radian) Depending on the terrain properties and solar geometry, the surface may be in the shadow of nearby topographic features; is then assigned a value of zero that represents no direct irradiances. Diffuse radiation was assumed to be isotropic in distribution in the atmosphere, i.e. the sky is uniformly bright. Depending on the slope and nearby topography, only a fraction of hemisphere might be visible, which is referred as the sky- view factor , which is time invariant and is dependent only on terrain parameters. The total or global irradiances (Wm-2) received on surface at any instance is given by, (14) The is determined as the ratio of diffuse sky irradiance to that on an unobstructed surface. In present algorithm, this was computed using expression given by Kondratyev (1977). Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 346 = (15) 20.4.2. Cloudy-sky model A three-layer scheme was conceptualized and implemented to compute irradiances in cloudy skies. The first layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere over cloud-top where direct and diffuse components were computed using algorithm mentioned in section 3.1. Molecular (above cloud) and aerosol scattering, gaseous transmission due to ozone were considered. Entire aerosol and ozone were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Both direct and diffuse components were computed and the sum of these two resulted into global irradiances without any sky-view factor. The second layer corresponds to plane parallel cloud. The vertical cloud structure and its three-dimensional effects on cloud transmission especially on diffuse component were not considered in the present model. The third layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere below cloud. Molecular scattering (air below cloud) was only considered in layer 3. The precipitable water was assumed entirely distributed below cloud and contributed to gaseous
