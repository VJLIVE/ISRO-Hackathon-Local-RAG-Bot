K has been taken keeping tropical region as the context. (4) View zenith angle (VZA): 0 to 60 degree. (5) Land surface emissivity: Emissivity values from the standard International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover types, major 10 major land cover types (ocean water, snow, sand, crop, shrubs, grass, forest, savanna, wetland, urban) have been considered from the MODTRAN database. Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 291 A set of radiosonde and satellite sounder profiles over tropical region from the SeeBor dataset (Borbas et al. 2005; Seeman et al. 2008) is selected for input in MODTRAN simulations. Figure 6 shows a graph of atmospheric profiles covering the boundary layer atmospheric temperature from 257.4 to 315.3 K and water vapour concentration from 0.1 to 5 g/cm2 selected in the present study. Synthetic profiles were also generated from these basic profiles by modulating the surface temperature by Â±10 degree. The attenuation due to atmosphere has been considered because of uniformly mixed gases, namely, CO2, N2O, O3 and CH4 along with the water vapour in the MODTRAN forward simulations. The contribution due to solar radiation in the MIR channel is not considered in the simulations. All the transmittance and path radiance calculations were performed in the Imager thermal IR spectral channels by incorporating the spectral response function (figure 1) of the respective spectral channel. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 Columnar Water Vapour, g/cm2 Boundary Layer Temperature, K Figure 6. The atmospheric profiles from the SeeBor database used in the study. The water vapour content as a function of boundary layer temperature The band average emissivity values for various land cover types were used in the simulations with considering relative spectral response functions of INSAT 3D split channels (shown in figure 7).
