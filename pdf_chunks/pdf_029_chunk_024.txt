may have a different temporal resolution of the in-situ measurement, therefore, along with overall validation, the variation in validation results when using in-situ data at different temporal resolution will also be studied. 6.2.2 Handheld sun photometer validation Many of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to provide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. Ongoing and Past data from such campaigns will be sued for validation. 6.2.3 Satellite-based Inter-comparisons OCM-2 derived AOD may be validated by comparing them with aerosol optical depths derived by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS/VIIRS. The basic inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) Identification of locations where both sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) Extraction of data for storage in an inter-comparison archive; 3) Analysis of the differences between the measurements. 6.3 Provisional validation 6.3.1 Derived AOD maps Figures 6, 7, and 8 display the ability of the developed aerosol product to capture different sources of aerosols such as small to large-scale forest fires, dust storms, and anthropogenic activities over different parts of India. Due to high-resolution data (figure 6) it is evident that 22 the spatial distribution of aerosol over megacities such as Delhi can be monitored using the OCM-2 AOD product. The availability of high-resolution spatial distribution of aerosol from space over megacities will play a major role in developing a product such as ground particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) maps at a large scale, which will be helpful in monitoring of air- quality and developing mitigation techniques in metropolitan cities. In figure 8, the AOD map, fine mode fraction map, and AOD histogram are shown for data acquired by OCM-2 over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January 2021. The particle size distribution function from AERONET data at Bhola station, Bangladesh is also
