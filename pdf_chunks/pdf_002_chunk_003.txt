(MADRAS), Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropical par Radiométrie (SAPHIR), Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere (ROSA). To facilitate frequent observations over the tropics, the Megha-Tropiques is placed in a low inclination orbit (20o) at 867 km altitude that provides the coverage over the global tropical region with 14 orbits a day and 7 days of repeat cycle. The MADRAS onboard MT is a five-frequency, nine-channel, self-calibrating, microwave radiometer that sweeps a swath of ~1700 km in a conical scanning with local incidence angle of 53.5o on the surface of the Earth. The specifications of MADRAS are provided in Table 1. MADRAS observations are used to operationally derive Total Precipitable Water (TPW), Cloud Liquid Water (CLW), and Ocean Surface Wind Speed (OWS) over oceans, and rain over land and oceans using radiative transfer based approach developed by Varma et al. (2011) and a scattering index based approach developed by Gairola et al. (2011). The SAPHIR is a six-channel microwave sounder that carries out cross track scanning within 50o on both sides of the nadir and thereby providing variable incidence angle and variable pixel size over a swath of ~1700 km. The specifications of SAPHIR are given in Table 2. The SAPHIR that operates at frequencies around water vapor resonance line at 183.31 GHz is designed to provide clear-sky profiles of atmospheric humidity. Frequencies near 183.31 GHz show very high atmospheric absorption and the emitted radiations from the environment reaching to the satellite are dominated by contribution from broad atmospheric layers whose thickness and mean altitude vary with operating frequency as well as with humidity and temperature in the atmosphere. Using observations from SAPHIR channels, algorithms are developed to operationally derive the Atmospheric Humidity profiles (Gohil et al., 2013, Mathur et al., 2013). Rain is an
