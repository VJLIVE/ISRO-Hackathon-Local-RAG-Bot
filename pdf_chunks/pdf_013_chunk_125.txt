are precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature inversion results in fog. Thin cirrus clouds are not very exciting clouds from short to medium range weather activities but play a very crucial role in earth’s heat budget and also helps in tracking upper level winds. Thin cirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass through it but doesn’t allow outgoing infrared radiation thus increase the radiative energy and eventually leads to the warming of earth-atmosphere system. Cirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the Earth; they allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate changes will have to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the Earth's heat budget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation have been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 m) radiances observed from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; Gruber and Chen, 1988). The occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in these single channel approaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect cirrus in global (Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and Menzel, 1989) cloud studies. Clouds are very important to study at various spatial and temporal scale including its diurnal cycle. Diurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative exchange, precipitation, small and large-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly linked with clouds, therefore, underlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and Cox (1981) had reported the diurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal oscillations are part of dynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial scales (Foltz and Gray, 1979). The
