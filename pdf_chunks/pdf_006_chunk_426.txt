form of bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient will be generated. 20.7.2.2 Comparison with other sources of spatial data Comparison with other sources of insolation product over India or overlapping region such as insolation from MSG over Africa or insolation from GMS partly over Indian sub- continent, reanalysis product for one year and generation of error statistics, histogram matching 20.7.3 Validation results 20.7.3.1 Initial validation of instantaneous insolation estimates from limited observations of INSAT 3D ‘Imager’ In this study, INSAT 3D instantaneous surface insolation was compared with in situ measured incoming shortwave radiation by four-component net radiometer (model : CNR-1) placed at AMS at a height of 4 m from ground. The transmitted data through INSAT 3A were received at Bopal Earth Station (BES). The in situ data at half-an-hour interval for Hyatnagar (17.82ºN, 78.98ºE), Andhra Pradesh, Chakdah (23.06ºN, 88.54ºE), West Bengal, Sriharikota (13.62ºN, 80.22ºE), Andhra Pradesh, Hoshangabad (22.70ºN, 77.75ºE ), Madhya Pradesh, Khazwal (23.53ºN, 93.18ºE), Mizoram, Chilika (19.71ºN, 85.19ºE), Orissa were used to validate the INSAT 3D based estimates. The data coverage was good for AMS at Hyatnagar and Hoshangabad. The AMS data coverge was less in rest of the locations. Altogether 90 (ninety) datasets could be obtained from AMS for validation for the period 1 to 15 October 2013. Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 355 Figure 10. Validation of INSAT 3D instantaneous insolation with limited measurements from AMS The operational product (K1-VHR-INS) of instantaneous insolation estimates at 8 km spatial resolution from Kalpana-1 VHRR were obtained for 0330, 0500, 0530, 0600, 0630, 0700, 0730, 0800, 0830, 1130 for 1 to 15 October 2013 were obtained through MOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). The mean insolation from diurnal instances of Kalpana-1 VHRR was compared with mean insolation from ‘Imager’. A comparison was made between insolation estimates
