be cloud contaminated. However, this approach needs further modification. These segment WV brightness temperatures are used to derive an upper tropospheric relative humidity by using the empirical relation (2). Brightness temperatures depend strongly upon the satellite zenith angle since it increases the path length for the radiances reaching the satellite. Therefore, zenith angle is computed for each segment to be used with the regression equation. Satellite zenith angles are computed for every pixel using satellite-observer geometry using the following formula: Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 235  = (/2) – arc cos[sin()/sin()] --- (3) where, =arc sin[Re/(Re+H)] =arc tan[sin()*sin()/(1-sin()*cos()] =arc cos[sin(S)*sin(T)+cos(S)*cos(T)*cos(L)] Re = radius of Earth = 6378.16 km H = Altitude of satellite = 36000 km L = | LS – LT | (T,LT) is latitude and longitude of the target (S,LS) is latitude and longitude of the sub-satellite point 15.4.2 Theoretical Background In general a satellite sensor observes the total radiances in a spectral interval, which exits the atmosphere in the direction of the satellite sensor.
