TIR-1, TIR-2. Tsfc has been taken from the daily SST climatology. Step-6. Quality control/Editing of derived SST Only those SST values will be retained for which the following condition holds: (𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚−3𝜎) ≤𝑆𝑆𝑇≤(𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚+ 3𝜎) where, σ is the standard deviation of the daily climatological SST and SSTclim is the daily value of climatological SST. 3.4 Output SST maps and data (HDF5) are available every half hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and seasonally.

Comparison of operational products have also been performed with same in-situ SST data for the same period. We have taken 0.040 spatial resolution and 15 minutes’ temporal resolution for collocation. The daily products have also been compared with GHRSST (Group for High Resolution SST) daily SST products for the same period. 3.5.1.1 Comparison with in-situ: The in situ records acquired from In-situ quality monitor (Iquam) portal hosted by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are first temporally matched-up against the INSAT-3D/3DR extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the two data sources, the absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at which that location is viewed
