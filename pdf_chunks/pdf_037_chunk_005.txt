products will have the same information and format. The only difference will be related to auxiliary data (orbit, meteo files, calibrations, … ). Taken into account Jason-1/2 heritage, products will be split into several data sets : 1. One “reduced” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 NRT-SSHA, limited to 1 Hz sampling 2. One “standard” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 I/GDR, containing 1 Hz and 40 Hz values 3. One “expertise” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 SGDR, containing 1 Hz, 40 Hz and waveforms values. This file will not be generated in NRT. The following table shows the data sets available for each kind of product. Data set Reduced Standard Expertise OGDR X X IGDR X X X Products GDR X X X Table 1 – Data set availability per product An overview of the file format used for the data sets is given in section 2. Then the data sets are described from section 3 to section 6.

NETCDF FORMAT AND CF CONVENTION The NetCDF data format has been chosen to store the different data sets (one file per data set). This format is extremely flexible, self describing and has been adopted as a de-facto standard for many operational oceanography systems. What’s more, the files will follow the Climate and Forecast NetCDF conventions CF- 1.1 because these conventions provide a practical standard for storing. 2.2. THE NETCDF DATA MODEL A NetCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which they are identified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and relations among data fields in an array-oriented
