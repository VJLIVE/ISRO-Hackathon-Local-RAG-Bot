mean bias in NCEP SWR over the tropical ocean ranging from -10 to -30 W m-2, while NASA/DAO SWR biases ranged from -50 W m-2 in subsidence regions of the subtropics to -25 W m-2 in convective regions near the equator. Table-1 provides a summary of presently available SWR products from different source alongwith their merits and demerits. Note: LY products largely known as Large and Yeager product follows the earlier approach of Large and Nurser [2001], in which the NCEP surface radiation and precipitation are replaced by satellite-based estimates. The present Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document describes a methodology to estimate SWR from half-hourly estimates of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) obtained from Kalpana observations. Although we have shown the results with Kalpana derived OLR, but the same algorithm has been tested with the data from other Indian GEO satellites.
