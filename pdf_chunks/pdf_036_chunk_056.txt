S2 atmospheric tides Non-tidal High-frequency Dealiasing Correction Mog2D High Resolution ocean model on (I)GDRs. None for OGDRs. Ocean model forced by ECMWF atmospheric pressures after removing S1 and S2 atmospheric tides Tide Solution 1 GOT4.8 + S1 ocean tide. S1 load tide ignored Tide Solution 2 FES2004 + S1 and M4 ocean tides. S1 and M4 load tides ignored Equilibrium long-period ocean tide model From Cartwright and Taylor tidal potential Non-equilibrium long-period ocean tide model Mm, Mf, Mtm, and Msqm from FES2004 Solid Earth Tide Model From Cartwright and Taylor tidal potential Pole Tide Model Equilibrium model Wind Speed from Model ECMWF model Altimeter Wind Speed Model Derived from Jason-1 data Trailing edge variation Flag Derived from Matching Pursuit algorithm (from J. Tournadre, IFREMER) Ice Flag Derived from comparison of the model wet tropospheric correction to a dual-frequency wet tropospheric correction retrieved from radiometer brightness temperatures, with a default value issued from a climatology table Table 8 : Models and standards 3.2. Models and Editing on Version "d" Products 3.2.1. Orbit models SARAL/AltiKa orbit standards are based on Jason-2 GDR-D standards. Those are summarized below, the previous standard used on Jason-1/Jason-2 and ENVISAT missions (GDR_C) is also recalled : GDR-C GDR-D Gravity model EIGEN-GL04S-ANNUAL (2008) Non-tidal TVG : drifts in degree 2,3,4 zonal coeffs, C21/S21; Annual and semi-annual terms up to deg/ord 50 Solid Earth Tides: from IERS2003 conventions Ocean tides FES2004 Atmospheric gravity : 6hr NCEP pressure fields + tides from Horwitz-Cowley model Pole Tide: solid Earth and ocean from IERS2003 conventions Third bodies: Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars and EIGEN-GRGS_RL02bis_MEAN-FIELD (2011) Non-tidal TVG : Annual, Semi-annual, and drifts up to deg/ord 50 Solid Earth Tides: from IERS2003 conventions Ocean tides FES2004 Atmospheric gravity : 6hr NCEP pressure fields + tides from Biancale-Bode model Pole Tide: solid Earth and ocean
