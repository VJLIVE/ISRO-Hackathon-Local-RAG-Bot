respectively. These eigenvectors are derived from a statistical covariance matrix of a large profile set of temperature, moisture and ozone. Y = K.X = K.V.f =K ~ .f --------- (23) Corresponding iterative equation becomes, fn+1 = (K ~ n T E -1 K ~ n + nI) -1. {K ~ n T E -1 [dYn m + K ~ n fn)]} ---------- (24) Thus the retrieval problem is reduced to finding a set of coefficients that may be used with eigenvectors to update the meteorological variables. Statistical analysis of the GOES radiance information content (similar to INSAT-3D Sounder) reveals that five temperature and three water vapor eigenvectors explain all the variance in the sounder channels occurring above the instrument noise level (Ma et al 1999). Therefore, the physical retrieval problem has been reduced to one of solving for ten unknowns (five temperature eigenvector coefficients, three water vapor eigenvector coefficients, one ozone eigenvector coefficient, plus surface skin temperature perturbation) from 18 INSAT Sounder observations plus two surface observations: surface air temperature and humidity. In absence of the surface observations only sounder observations will be used for observation vector. At each iterative step in the physical retrieval procedure, convergence tests are carried out for the quality control of the profile retrievals. Following two convergence tests are carried out at each iteration and if one of the test fails, then the retrieval is rejected. (i) The expansion coefficient convergence test defines the coefficient distance, dn+1 defined by: dn+1 = (fn+1 - fn)T.( K ~ nTE-1K ~ n + nI)-1 (fn+1 - fn) ------- (25) This should approach zero as the solution converges. At each iteration, the norm of the coefficient distance d is calculated and compared with previous iteration. If dn+1 is smaller or equal to dn then iteration continues, else n is
