and brightness temperature. Depending on geo location extent, various categories of a product are defined. Depending on combinations of polarization/pass/look and temporal extent of data, various sub-categories of Level 4 products are defined. For a product (say, of sigma0, gamma0 or brightness temperature), the categories are described in Table 1 below: Table 1 Categories of Level 4 Products Category Sub-category Spatial Extent Lat. Range Lon. Range India VVDES, VVASC, VVBOTH, HHDES, HHASC, HHBOTH [6:40] [64:100] Global VVDES, VVASC, VVBOTH, HHDES, HHASC, HHBOTH [-90:90] [-180:180] NorthPolar24 VVBOTH, HHBOTH [60:90] [-180:180] NorthPolar72 VVDES, HHDES [60:90] [-180:180] SouthPolar24 VVBOTH, HHBOTH [-90:-50] [-180:180] SouthPolar72 VVASC, HHASC [-90:-50] [-180:180] The products for all three parameters will be generated once daily using previous Level 1B data products. The product generation strategy is described in Table 2 below: Table 2 Generation of Level 4 Products Category Product Generation for all sub-categories India Generated once every day using L1B products of last 48 hours, so 6 products per day per parameter Global Generated once every day using L1B products of last 48 hours, so 6 products per day per parameter NorthPolar24 Generated once every day using L1B products of last 24 hours, so 2 products per day per parameter NorthPolar72 Generated once every day using L1B products of last 72 hours, so 2 products per day per parameter SouthPolar24 Generated once every day using L1B products of last 24 hours, so 2 products per day per parameter SouthPolar72 Generated once every day using L1B products of last 72 hours, so 2 products per day per parameter 2 The Polar products will be having data for all the features such as land, ocean or ice. However, Global and India products will be having data for pure land only. The product format is GeoTIFF. The India Products and Global Products
