COORDINATE VARIABLES AND AUXILIARY COORDINATE VARIABLES A variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate variable. It typically defines a physical coordinate corresponding to that dimension. In accordance with the Climate and Forecast conventions, we must declare a coordinate variable for each dimension. What’s more, missing values are not allowed in coordinate variables and they must be strictly monotonic. An auxiliary coordinate variable is a netCDF variable that contains coordinates data but is not a coordinate variable as defined above. Unlike coordinate variables, there is no relationship between the name of an auxiliary coordinate variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s). 2.2.4. ATTRIBUTES NetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary data or metadata), similar in many ways to the information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional database systems. Most attributes provide information about a specific variable. These are identified by the name of that variable, together with the name of the attribute. Some attributes provide information about the data set as a whole. They are called global attributes. The following table shows the variable attributes used in the SARAL product. There are no mandatory attributes. Attribute Description _FillValue A value used to represent missing or undefined data add_offset If present, this number is to be added to the date after it is read by an application. If both scale_factor and add_offset attributes are present, the date are first scaled before the offset
