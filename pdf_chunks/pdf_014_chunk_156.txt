values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific visible INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 139 tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as the final height. Once the final height using the above height assignment method is established, the pressure height is optimized using minimized differences with first guess winds up to 75 hPa in upwards and downwards directions. 13.4.3. Tracking If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 24 X 24 template (in pixel) in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). It is defined as             n i t t n i s t I I I I E 1 2 1 2 1 (2) Where tI and sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and tI is the average of variance of template
