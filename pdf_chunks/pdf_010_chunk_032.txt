atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, water vapor, and ozone concentrations. These profiles are extracted from the TIGR-3 database, which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected among a larger set of worldwide soundings. Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone from ECMWF were also taken. The surface temperature is set close to the temperature at the level close to surface in the profile. The cloud cover is generated randomly. The cloud cover may contain up to three overlapping layers, each characterized by a random height, optical thickness, phase (water or ice), and drop size distribution. Half of the database (2352 elements) corresponds to cloud-free conditions and the other half corresponds to the same conditions but with the addition of cloud cover. For each element in the database, the OLR and the spectral radiance field L (={0º, 5º, . . . 65º}) are computed. Filter response function for the INSAT-3D imager WV and thermal channel (TIR-1 and TIR- 2) were provided as input to the SBDART. Radiances were simulated for each set of profile Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 36 and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (70 km) from SBDART for WV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 channels. 3.4.1.3 Conversion of Narrow Band Radiances to Broad Band Flux (OLR) ALG-1 is developed using RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances. While ALG-2 is developed using the INSAT-3D radiances and collocated (in space and time) CERES measured OLR. In practice, development of ALG-2 is possible only after the launch of INSAT-3D. However, to develop the preliminary version, we have used Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2D (positioned at 86.5º E) radiances to generate proxy radiances for INSAT-3D. This is due to the fact that INSAT-3D channels (TIR-1, TIR- 2 and WV), which will be
