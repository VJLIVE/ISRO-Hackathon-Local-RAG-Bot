the presence of noise in radar data. Among these multiple wind vector solutions, only one solution corresponds to true wind vector while others are ambiguities also known as “ aliases”. Although, the wind speed solutions are very close to each other, the direction solutions are quite apart. The solutions are prioritized (or ranked) based on certain criterion used in algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of percentage of highest priority (rank-1) solutions correctly identifying the true directions out of the total number of data cases processed. Under noise-free conditions, the rank-1 solution always represents the true wind vector but for noisy or real data, it is always not so. However, the first two highest ranked solutions contain the true direction most of the times. The selection of vector solution nearest to the true wind vector is performed through the directional ambiguity removal algorithm. An overall scheme for retrieval of wind vector field is depicted in figure (7). 13 WIND VECTOR SOLUTIONS RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM GEOPHYSICAL MODEL FUNCTIONS DIRECTIONAL AMBIGUITY REMOVAL ALGORITHM FILTERED WIND VECTOR FIELD LOCALIZED AMBIGUITY REMOVAL ALGORITHM RAIN IMPACT MODEL RAIN FLAGGING ALGORITHM PRIORITIZED WIND VECTOR SOLNS (RAIN-FREE) FINAL WIND VECTOR FIELD OCEANIC RADAR BACKSCATTER DATA Figure 7: An overall scheme for retrieval of wind vector field 5.1 Algorithm for retrieval of wind vector solutions: The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) algorithm developed based on Bayesian approach is the best algorithm (Chi and Li, 1988), which is widely and operationally used for the scatterometer missions launched so far. More so, variants of MLE algorithm have also been developed (Stoffelen and Anderson, 1997; Stoffelen and Portabella, 2006) with difference in its implementation. In some of the variants of MLE, a transformed MLE has also been developed. The algorithm developed recently is based on transformed MLE, which is
