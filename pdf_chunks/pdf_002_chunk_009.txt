(1998), and PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et al. (1997). The TRMM sensor package has been described by Kummerow et al. (1998), and PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et al. (1997). The dataset of PR-SAPHIR concurrent observations is prepared by collocating SAPHIR and PR observations over space and time. We assume a circular foot print of SAPHIR of diameter 10 km at the nadir and that varies linearly to 22 km at the beginning and end of a scan line (i.e., pixel # 1 and 182). We find all the PR observations that fall on a SAPHIR footprint within 10 minutes of time difference and calculate the weighted average surface rain rate from PR observations. The weight is varied commensurating for an assumed isotropic antenna gain pattern over the footprint. This way we generate a collocated SAPHIR-PR dataset for March 2013 for further analysis. We refer it as training dataset in the succeeding part of this report. Given the temporal variability of the precipitation (Piyush et al., 2012) and non-circular footprint of the SAPHIR away from nadir, collocation of two datasets in spatial and temporal domain is not the perfact, yet keeps the procedure of collocation simple while providing a large collocated dataset of about 1.7 million observations over the ocean and 0.7 million over land. The rain identification and retrieval scheme have been performed separately for the land and oceans. We further divided dataset into rainy and non-rainy sets for 182 swath positions of the SAPHIR. We examine the probability distribution (PDF) of brightness temperatures measured at all 6 channels of SAPHIR for rainy and non-rainy conditions for all scan locations. Figure 1 (a) to (f) show plots of PDFs of SAPHIR brightness temperatures for channel S1 and S6 for a typical scan
