that algorithm works satisfactorily. 4. Operational Implementation Steps (a) We have static binary files for rain/no-rain probability over land and oceans. For given geolocation (land/ocean) and pixel-scan position, the probabilities of rain/no-rain for brightness temperature from each of the six channels are instantaneously available. These procedures are incorporated in the Fortran program. The probability values in the binary files are having 182*400*6 (are arranged in following manner: Record =1 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 1 K Record =2 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 2 K . . Record =400 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 400 K Record =401 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S2, Tb= 1 K . . Record =400*6 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S6, Tb= 400 K Record =400*6+1 – probability for pixel # 2, channel S1, Tb= 1 K . . Record =182*400*6(436800) – probability for pixel # 182, channel S6, Tb= 400 K 11 The above arrangement of records, enable us to find the probability value instantaneously for given pixel position, brightness temperature and frequency channel from the input data file. This can be calculated as follows: irec=(k-1)*2400+(j-1)*400+i where, irec is record number for finding the probability, k is scan position number, j is channel number and I is brightness temperature in integer. The probability values are available at each discreet integer values of the brightness temperatures. For fractional part of the brightness temperatures, the probability is calculated by linear interpolation from two adjacent integer values are performed. (b) Once the step 1 is completed, based on probability associated with all 6 channels we find average probability of rain as PRR and probability of no-rain as PNR. We then normalize them to get probability of rain (PR) and probability
