the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is N (SD) = [1/N ∑ ( (Vdi) – (MVD) )2 ]1/2 I=1 The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, (RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. N (BIAS)i = 1/N ∑ [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ] i=1 N (MVD) = 1/N ∑ (VD)i i=1 Visible wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 210 To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. 13.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. VIS wind are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have
