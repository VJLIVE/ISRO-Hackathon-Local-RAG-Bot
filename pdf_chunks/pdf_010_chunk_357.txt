nadir. Pandya et al. (2011a) have also shown that at-sensor radiance value observed by the Imager sensor reduces with increasing view zenith angle by an amount of 7 to 8 percent for 300 K target. This has a significant effect on the satellite measured brightness temperature. For a target on the ground having 300 K temperature and 0.98 emissivity with average atmospheric water vapor of 1.5 g/cm2, the at-sensor brightness temperature varies between 297.2 K to 295.5 K for atmospheric path length changing from 1 to 2 corresponding to view zenith angle varying between 0 to 60 degree (figure 5). If a SW algorithm’s coefficients are determined for the nadir case, then use of same coefficients for all the view angles can significantly degrade the algorithm accuracy at large view angles. The standard MODIS algorithm addressed this problem (Wan & Dozier, 1996). Here, in the case of Imager sensor the view zenith angle can vary nominally up to 50 degree, so we intend to generate a unique set of split-window coefficients for each view angle sub-ranges (e.g., 00–200, 200–300300–350, 350–400, 400–450, 450–500 and 500–550). 295.2 295.6 296 296.4 296.8 297.2 0 20 40 60 Brightness temperature, 10.3-11.3 um band View zenith angle, degree Figure 5. Effect of view zenith angle on the temperature observed at satellite level 18.4.2 Model used The satellite level signal in the TIR channels of Imager sensor was simulated using a RT model – MODTRAN (MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANSmittance) version 4.0. The MODTRAN (Berk et al. 1999) was selected for the study because this model has been long publicly available and its heritage traces back to LOWTRAN (Kneizys et al. 1988). It is widely used and validated model for variety of remote sensing analysis and applications across the globe. It uses a more accurate and
