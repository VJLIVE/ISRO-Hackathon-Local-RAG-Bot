INSAT-3DR level-2 cloud mask product. In absence of the INSAT-3DR cloud mask product the cloudy pixels are detected through cloud mask routine based on threshold and spatial coherence techniques in visible, MIR and thermal bands. Threshold technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness temperature in thermal band (TIR-1) is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in decreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is based on the assumption that SST is homogeneous in smaller spatial domain and sufficiently warmer than clouds; thus clouds can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value or larger standard deviation. In addition to above the following thresholds criteria as described in ATBD of MODIS (Ackerman et al., 2006) cloud mask product have also been used. During day time the reflection in MIR channels dominates over emission; therefore, in general MIR BT can be higher than TIR-1 BT by up to ~6K for clear-sky. However, for MIR channel the reflection coefficient is higher for cloud top than earth’s surface. Hence the difference of TIR1 and MIR BTs becomes more negative for cloudy sky. The visible reflectance is very high for clouds as compared to earth’s surface. Hence, higher visible albedo (>5 %) or reflectance corresponds to cloudy sky. During day-time (solar zenith angle < 80 degree) the following threshold criterion has been used to detect cloudy pixels: 𝑇1 −𝑇3 < −6.0 & (𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡> 70 𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑜> 5) where, T1 and T3 are the brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and MIR channels of INSAT-3D/3DR, respectively. During night there is no solar reflection at MIR wavelength hence satellite measures only emitted radiation. Since cloud emissivity is lower for MIR as compared to TIR-1 wavelength, the brightness temperature corresponding to MIR will be smaller than that of TIR-1
