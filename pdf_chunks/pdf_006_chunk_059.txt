of Deep Convective Clouds Fractional Rain Cloud Coverage Estimation of Rainfall Generation of 24 Classes Histogram, mean & variance Estimation of daily Rainfall (8 images) Estimation of Monthly Rainfall Estimation of Seasonal Rainfall Rainfall Validation (DWR/SFRG) Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 54 images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and 30 to 130 deg longitude from the sub-satellite point. Step 3: Grid-wise Statistics Generate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. Step 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: The fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler than specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon will be carried out. This work indicated a high correlation between the fractional coverage of "cold" clouds and observed rainfall. It was determined that the highest correlation between the parameters was produced using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. An estimation method using linear regression was developed. The regression procedure yielded the simple estimation equation: R = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours] where R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of cloud-top temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period. Step: 5 Sub-Grid Scale Rainfall: In order to produce precipitation estimates at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, it is necessary to develop an improved method. Sub –grid scale is
