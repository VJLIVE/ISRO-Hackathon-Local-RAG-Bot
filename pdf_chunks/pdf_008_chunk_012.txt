H-E rain in better perspective, we have provided the comparison of 3B42RT with IMD WWR. It may be recalled that 3B42RT is an IR and microwave merged product. Further comparison is made between hourly CPC 1oX1o latitude-longitude gridded rain with H-E rain for period from 23-27 October 2013. The comparison statistics is provided in Table 2 below. For comparison in smaller spatial and temporal scales, a comparison SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 10 of INSAT-3D H-E with TRMM 3B41RT hourly rain in 0.25oX0.25o latitude-longitude grid is made for period 20-24 Sep 2014. The TRMM 3B41RT is a microwave derived rain product and is available hourly. Fig. 5: Comparison of weekly meteteorological sub-division averaged rain for 7 weeks from 29 May to 16 July 2014 between (a) IMD WWR and H-E rain, (b) TRMM- 3B42RT and H-E rain, and (c) TRMM 3B42RT and IMD WWR. Table 2: Comparison statistics of rain from H-E with CPC and 3B41RT Comparison between CPC and INSAT-3D H-E Rain Period Time Scale Spatial Grid R Rmsd Bias 23-27 Oct 2013 Daily 1oX1o 0.69 17.01 mm 3.13 mm Comparison between 3B41RT and INSAT-3D H-E Rain 20-24 Sep 2014 Hourly 0.25oX0.25o 0.59 1.06 mm/h 0.12 4.0 Need for further Improvements in Hydro-Estimator The results presented in section 3.0 above show a reasonable good agreement between H-E rain and surface observations. The most of the result presented in the above section are dominated by regions that are either oceans or have moderate elevations from the sea level. Figure 6 below shows the comparison of IMD Weekly WWR met-subdivision accumulated rain for 7 weeks with corresponding H-E rain averaged over 4 typical high orographic met-subdivisions, viz. Arunachal Pradesh (AP), Uttrakhand (UK), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), The Fig. 6 shows that H-E rain estimated for areas with high altitudes
