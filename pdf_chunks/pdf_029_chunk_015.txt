aerosol types and also increases the probability of retrieval over bright targets. Apart from this many other differences such as red and NIR bands are not assumed transparent, simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface in NIR and red bands, etc., makes the current aerosol retrieval algorithm novel when compared to existing ones, though none of them are feasible for implementation with OCM-2 sensor. 4.3.1 Gas absorption In addition to the aerosols and molecular scattering, certain atmospheric gases may also affect OCM-2 channels. In the VNIR region, primarily three atmospheric gas may absorb the incident solar radiation and upwelling radiation namely water vapour (H2O), ozone (O3), and oxygen (O2). The expression for ozone optical thickness, 𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM: 𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) = 𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) 𝐷𝑈 (1) where, 𝐷𝑈 refer to total column ozone in Dobson unit and 𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) is the extinction coefficient that relates optical thickness with concentration. Table 4 show the values of 𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM- 2 channels. From table 4 it can be seen that band-5 and band-6 centered at 550 and 620 nm, respectively are significantly affected by ozone absorption. The top of the atmosphere radiance is corrected by ozone transmittance. The relation for the ozone transmittance is: 𝑇𝑜𝑧= exp [−𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆){(𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃)−1 + (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃0)−1}] (2) 14 Since OCM-2 channels are selected in atmospheric windows, therefore, absorption due to water vapour and oxygen is expected to be insignificant. To verify this figure 3 shows the transmittance due to water vapour at different concentrations (2, 4, and 6 cm) and the standard value of oxygen for the tropical atmosphere. From figure 3, it is clear that that band 2, 3, 5 and 6 are completely free from the water vapour or oxygen absorption. Band 8 is also almost free from water vapour but with very little contamination, however. Table 5 shows the water vapour
