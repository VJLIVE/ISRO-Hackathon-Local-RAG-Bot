little higher deviation during August and September. It showed RMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean). INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 222 Figure 7.

Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation The daily estimated and AMS ETo was compared for different time windows viz. 3-day, 5-day, 7- day and 10-day. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured ETo gradually increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from daily to 7-day i.e from 8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah (BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer (6.3%) as compared to LPSC (Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. Similarly per cent deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the deviation drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day except than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days as marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from daily to 7-days and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help us use this ETo data in various applications on different time scales with known errors. Figure 9. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation 17.7.1.4. Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere Considering the results of Penmanâ€“Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate
