Bhattacharya Potential evapo- transpiration baseline document 19.2 Introduction The process of evapotranspiration (ET) acts as one of the main drivers of the hydrological or water cycle. One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between the energy and water cycles. The potential ET rate (ETo) is influenced by several factors such as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among them, solar radiation is the most sensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% variability of ETo . The potential evapo-transpiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass reference evapo-transpiration (ETo), is expressed in terms of amount of water transferred per unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface covered with
