and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A similar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been proven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year (Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished using the NDSI. Other promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, spectral- mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable for automatic application at the mountainous region. They are also computationally intensive. Training or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application of techniques such as neural- network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional applications and possibly even global application in future years. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 18 In fractional snow cover, presently snow cover products derived using AWiFS data will be used to develop the approach. INSAT derived snow was matched with synchronous AWiFS snow pixels which was used to develop a relationship for snow fraction of INSAT pixel. 1.4.2. Theoretical Background 1.4.2.1. Snow cover map The snow-cover mapping algorithm is designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A regional, daily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will be generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield maximum snow extent for the 10-day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit during that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free on all of the other orbits during the 10- day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the data product. There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps (Kulkarni et al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps and
