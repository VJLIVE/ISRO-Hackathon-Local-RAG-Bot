absorption for different values of water vapour and the standard value of oxygen (tropical atmosphere). Solar zenith assumed is 45 degrees and nadir viewing geometry. Figure 4. Scatter plot for modelled surface reflectance in band-3 and band-6 versus surface reflectance obtained by atmospheric correction using in-situ data. Figure 5. The overall workflow of the algorithm. Figure 6. AOD map on 2 November 2016. High resolution (700m) of OCM-2 AOD enables one to capture high AOD/dust plume due to dust transportation from dust storms, which originated within India and in neighboring countries (e.g., Pakistan-Afghanistan border as shown). Figure 7. High resolution (700m) from OCM-2 AOD enables one to capture high AOD/smoke plumes due to forest fires in North-East India and the neighboring countries. Figure 8. (a) AOD map over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January 2021. A very thick layer of aerosol (heavy air pollution) over IGP is observed. (b) Fine mode fraction map shows high fine aerosols in the entire IGP while relatively coarser sized particles in central India. (d) AERONET size distribution at Bhola station showing the dominance of fine mode aerosol. Figure 9. Validation results of the OCM-2 AOD using AERONET in-situ AOD at different stations. Figure 10. Drastic improvement in OCM-2 derived NDVI after correction for aerosol is apparent in the images shown. List of Tables Table 1. Summary of the OCM-2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) product Table 2.
