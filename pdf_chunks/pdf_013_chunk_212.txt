retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. The error analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A complete error statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation etc.) will be performed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months). Rainfall maps on every 1/2 hourly and daily basis on pixel and any desired bigger grid spacing will be produced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color shades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE from IMSRA over meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis System Group. Accordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and validation. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 183 15.6.1.
