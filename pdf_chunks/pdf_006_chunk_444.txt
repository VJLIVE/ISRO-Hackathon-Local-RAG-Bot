some of the downbursts and give early warning to pilots (Roland Stull, 2000). In India dry desert regions, elevated plains, mountain regions where air is very dry may be susceptible to microburst. Generally dry microburst occurs in situations characterized by high convective cloud bases and strong evaporational cooling in the sub-cloud layer, resulting in little or no precipitation at the surface. 4.2.2 Objective To compute dry microburst index based on an empirical formula. 4.3 Inputs 4.3.1 Dynamic Data Retrieved temperature and humidity profile at standard pressure levels. 4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 4.4.1 Overview 4.4.1.2 Theoretical Background Dry microburst index is generally calculated using the formula, 500 700 ) ( ) ( d d T T T T DMI       Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 375  - lapse rate (oC km-1) of the layer from 700 hPa to melting level (i.e. layer at 0o C), T – Temperature (oC), Td – Dew point (oC). Usually DMI is not calculated for any retrieval unless the following three conditions are satisfied: (1)  > 6 K km-1 ( somewhat stable for convective activity) (2) (T - Td)700 >= 8 K (implies a very dry atmosphere close to surface) (3) (T-Td)500 <= 8 K (implies some level of saturation at this level) Suitability of these conditions needs to be studied for the Indian region. 4.4.2 Operational Implementation Operational implementation simply involves evaluation of the quantities in the formula 500 700 ) ( ) ( d d T T T T DMI       . 4.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution DMI - - 2-3oC 0.5 x 0.5 deg 4.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Lat, Lon, DMI Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 30
