channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, 490, 510, 550, 620, 740 and 865 nm with high radiometric accuracy. The overall workflow for the proposed algorithm/technique for aerosol retrieval using OCM-2 data is shown in section 4.4. It mainly involves four components: (a) Masking of the pixel for which retrieval is not possible (e.g., cloud, water, and saturated pixels), (b) The surface characterization in visible-channels, (c) Radiative transfer simulation, and (d) The aerosol inversion. 13 The aerosol retrieval algorithm described in this ATBD is novel/different from other existing aerosol retrieval algorithms such as dark-target or deep-blue in many ways that make it capable to derive aerosols from VNIR sensors. Following are the salient points of the algorithm: (a) The surface characterization in visible channels is shown to be possible by the use of near Infrared channel measurements, where the existing algorithm uses the SWIR channel over dark targets and reflectivity database over bright surfaces. Thus this algorithm avoids the necessity of SWIR measurement as well as doesnâ€™t require the pre-existence of a surface reflectivity database. (b) Different from the dark-target algorithm, the surface characterization strategy in this algorithm is not limited to vegetative surfaces but is also valid over moderately bright surfaces, which enables AOD retrieval over both moderately bright as well as dark surfaces. (c) Different from the dark-target, deep-blue algorithm and others where blue and red channels are used for aerosol inversion, in this algorithm aerosol inversion is based on two blue channels which allows more accurate selection of aerosol types and also increases the probability of retrieval over bright targets. Apart from this many other differences such as red and NIR bands are not assumed transparent, simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface in NIR and red bands, etc., makes the current aerosol retrieval algorithm novel when compared to
