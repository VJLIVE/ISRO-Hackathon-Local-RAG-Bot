The spatial extend and dynamics cannot be adequately nowcasted using conventional ground measurements (Jacobs et al, 2003). However, the upcoming INSAT-3D data with improved spatial and temporal resolution can be used for near real time detection and mapping of fog. The detection of fog/low stratus with satellite data has been taken up since many years (Bendix 2002. The general methodology of fog detection involves identification of some threshold radiances or brightness temperature at different wavelengths. Fog is formed when vapor in the lower atmosphere condensed in cold conditions. The fog droplets are much smaller than the cloud droplet. The presence of these droplets affects the atmospheric visibility. The radiation difference between the cloud and fog is due to the spectral response differences of every channel. This provides the basis of fog
