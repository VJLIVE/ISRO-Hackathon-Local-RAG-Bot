for the fast model. The inverse problem: Inverse problem in the satellite meteorology is to obtain the state of the atmosphere (in terms of its vertical profiles of temperature and constituents) from the radiance measurements. Since we have a limited number of channels the inversion of equation is ill posed or under- constrained. This means that there exist an infinite number of profiles that satisfy a given set of measurements. This is because the atmospheric state (unknown, e.g. temperature profile) is a continuous function of height, and measurements are from a finite number of channels. Inverse problem is to find one that is reasonable and, if possible, to find the profile which is best or most reasonable in some sense. In addition, the measurements always contain some error or "noise". This further increases the ill-posed nature of the problem, and we must find a method of solution that does not amplify the noise to an unacceptable degree. This implies that we need information additional to the measurements in order to reach a solution. For atmospheric remote sensing, additional information is available in the form of numerical model forecast and surface observation analysis. There are several approaches for solution of this problem: 1. Physical retrieval ) 2 ( .) 0 ( )]. ( [ ) 0 ( ).
