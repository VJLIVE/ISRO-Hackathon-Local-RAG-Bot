Introduction The geostationary satellite derived winds, also known as Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) are considered as one of the most reliable source of wind information over oceanic region where normal ground based observations are very rare. Presently in India operationally AMVs are available from two advanced meteorological satellites INSAT-3D (Deb et al., 2016, Kishtawal et al., 2009) and INSAT-3DR using consecutive 30-minutes images (www.mosdac.gov.in). It is also well established that assimilation of AMVs in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model leads to significant improvement in the weather forecast (Deb et al, 2010; Kaur et al., 2015; Kumar et al. 2016) over the Indian Ocean region. The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR in staggering mode and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D/3DR have two IR window channels (10.5-11.5μ and 11.5-12.5 μ). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived AMV and INSAT-3D/3DR IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 14.2.1.
