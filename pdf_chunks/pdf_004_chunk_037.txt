fitted curves of SD, respectively, as shown in figure (16b). The fitted curves used for calculating SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are shown in figure (16b). The threshold multiplier MSD varying from 1.8 to 2.2 is used for rain detection and has impact on rain detection under rain-free and rainy situations as shown in figure (16c). The above scheme has been tested with simulated data and the performance of rain flagging under rain-free and rainy situations has been evaluated as depicted in figure (16c). The overall proportionate success is a weighted success considering fractions of rain-free (about 90 percent) and rainy (about 10 percent) events at any given time over the globe as reported in literature (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Stiles and Yueh, 2002; Draper and Long, 2004; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000). For no-rain situations it is observed that the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for raining cases, the missing rain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies made elsewhere (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000). 32 Figure (16): Rain flagging using NSD algorithm at K=1.5, a) Scatter plots of rank-1 SD and rank-1 wind speed under rain-free and rain conditions, b) Trends of rain-free mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD for binned wind speed considering all WVC, c) Rain flagging performance for rain-free and rainy situations for different flagging thresholds. 6.4 Sea-ice flagging (Brief introduction): Sea-ice altering the radar backscatter measurements affects the wind retrieval. The radar backscattered signal from the earthâ€™s surface is dependent on the roughness at the scale of the radar wave length, the incidence angle, and the dielectric properties of the surface, which for sea ice means ice salinity, temperature, air inclusion, liquid water fraction in snow and ice, and snow cover (Haarpaintner et al,
