then convoluted to OCM-2 spectral response functions to simulate observations. The radiative scattering due to aerosols is simulated assuming 2 fine aerosol models defined as moderately and strongly absorbing aerosols, and 1 coarse aerosol model named dust aerosol model. The optical properties (extinction and scattering coefficients, single scattering albedo, phase function, and asymmetry factor) of the basic modes (accumulation and coarse modes) are computed from the Mie theory assuming multi-modal log-normal distribution defined by 𝑛(𝑟) = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑓𝑖 𝑟𝑙𝑛𝜎𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑝[ 𝑙𝑛2𝑟/𝑟𝑚,𝑖 2𝑙𝑛2𝜎𝑖], (12) where 𝑁 is the number of modes, 𝑟 is the particle radius, 𝑟𝑚,𝑖 is the mean radius of mode 𝑖, 𝜎𝑖 is the width of mode 𝑖, and 𝑓𝑖 is the number density of mode 𝑖. These parameters and the refractive index (𝑚𝑖= 𝑚𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙+ 𝑚𝑖,𝑖𝑚𝑔) for each mode used in Mie calculations are taken from Levy et al., 2007. An exponential profile of AOD with a scaled height of 2 km is assumed. In the current version of the algorithm, to reduce the computational time of operational retrieval of AOD, RT simulation-based look-up-tables (LUTs) are generated and saved as the auxiliary database, which is used to calculate the 𝜌𝑠𝑎𝑡 ∗ as a function of solar zenith 𝜃𝑜, sensor zenith 𝜃, relative azimuth angle Δ𝜙, 𝜌𝑠 and AOD (varied from 0-5). LUTs corresponding to 𝐴𝑂𝐷= 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2, 3.0, 5.0 for each spectral band are generated and saved. Each LUT contains calculated path reflectance for ten 𝜃𝑜 and 𝜃 values ranging from 0.0 to 72.0 with an interval of 6.0 degrees and for sixteen Δ𝜙 values ranging from 0.0 to 180.0 with an interval of 12 degrees. For RT simulation several ready-to-use codes are freely available, however, in the current version of the algorithm, the discrete ordinate method is used for which CDISORT code
