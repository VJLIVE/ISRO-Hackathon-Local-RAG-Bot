Processing System (IMDPS) project to be used in radiance assimilation in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The high-temporal resolution data of INSAT-3D Sounder (hourly observations) would be extremely useful for monitoring and predicting of the fast developing weather systems through 4D-VAR radiance assimilation in NP models. 8.3. Algorithm Description The following sections provide details of the procedure for generating CSBT products: 8.3.1. Cloud detection The first step in CSBT product generation is to filter out cloud contaminated pixels from the Sounder observations and generate a cloud-flag for each of the pixels. This section provides the physical basis for detection of the cloudy pixels from INSAT-3D Sounder observations. The output of cloud mask algorithm gives the degree of presence of a cloud in it. This information enables the subsequent steps to use this information for further processing. The cloud detection algorithm is carried out in three steps. The flow chart is shown in fig.1. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 93 Fig.1: Flow chart of the Sounder cloud detection algorithm The cloud detection methodology for INSAT-3D sounder follows operational GOES sounder cloud detection procedure developed by Schreiner et al. (2001). This cloud detection algorithm uses 4 infrared channels and a visible channel during daytime for cloud detection and 5 infrared channels for the detection of nighttime clouds. One additional infrared channel is used to detect clouds appearing at dawn time. The various channels used in cloud detection are summarized below: Ch#3 - 13.3 µm (“CO2 absorption”, used for detection of thin cirrus) Ch#6 - 12.6 µm (“Moderate WV-absorption”, used in detecting some low level inversions) Ch#7 - 12.0 µm (“Weak WV-absorption”, used in detecting low clouds and fog) Ch#8 - 11.0 µm (“Longwave Window”, used in detecting various level of clouds) Ch#17 - 4.0 µm (“Shortwave Window”, used to detect
