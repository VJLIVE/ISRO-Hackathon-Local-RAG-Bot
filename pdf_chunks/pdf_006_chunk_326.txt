~ nTE-1K ~ n + nI)-1 (fn+1 - fn) ------- (25) This should approach zero as the solution converges. At each iteration, the norm of the coefficient distance d is calculated and compared with previous iteration. If dn+1 is smaller or equal to dn then iteration continues, else n is increased, and dn+1 is recalculated for the nth iteration. This procedure of changing  continues until the norm of dn+1 is less then or equal to the norm of dn, and the iteration further continues towards convergence until the difference between the norm of dn+1 and the norm of dn is less than an experimental threshold (~0.1). If the norm of dn+1 less than or equal to the norm of dn is not met by the third increase in n, the retrieval Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 261 process is considered to be non-convergent and physical retrieval is assumed to be failed. (ii) Second convergence criteria is based on the brightness temperature residual test. The rms residual is defined by: (rn+1)2 = [Ykm – Yk(Xn+1)]2/nch; ------- (26) Where k is channel number, nch is total channel used in the iterative procedure. If rn+1  rn the iteration continue until rn+1 is acceptably small (less then instrument noise). Ancillary surface information is used as boundary condition for the profile solutions. The surface air temperature and humidity are treated as additional “channels” to assist the better retrieval of near surface atmospheric parameters. These surface observations may be within 30 minutes in time and 50 km in space of sounding time/location. Following two additional equations are added in Eq.23 if surface ancillary information is available:    nt i t i t i ls v f ls t 1 ) ( ) ( 
