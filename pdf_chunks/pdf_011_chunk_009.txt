temperatures of TIR-1 and MIR channels of INSAT-3D/3DR, respectively. During night there is no solar reflection at MIR wavelength hence satellite measures only emitted radiation. Since cloud emissivity is lower for MIR as compared to TIR-1 wavelength, the brightness temperature corresponding to MIR will be smaller than that of TIR-1 BT for cloudy pixels. Hence, during night-time (solar zenith angle >= 80 degree) the following threshold is used to mask the cloudy pixels: SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 9 𝑇1 −𝑇3 > −1.0 SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. 3.1.4 Error Analysis A simulation based sensitivity study of noise in TIR-1 & TIR-2 channels’ BTs on the SST retrieval has been carried out to analyze the errors in the retrieved SST. The simulations have been performed through PFAAST radiative transfer model using atmospheric profiles from ECMWF diverse training dataset for INSAT-3D spectral response functions. The following figure (2) is showing the impact of noise in both the channels on the errors in the retrieved SST. From the figure it can be clearly pointed out that if both the channels have uncertainty of 0.1K, the theoretical error in retrieved SST would be ~ 0.7K. If uncertainty in both the channels is ~0.05K the minimum possible error in the retrieved SST would be 0~.55K. Fig. 2: Sensitivity of total noise in the retrieval of SST from INSAT-3D Imager It can also be inferred from the figure (2) that using split-window channels the best possible SST accuracy of 0.5K could be achieved. For getting better than 0.5K accuracy, one should opt other atmospheric WV correction techniques as used in ATSR mission which gives approximately 0.3K (Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1988; Barton, et al., 1993) errors in retrieved SST. In ATSR dual- view configuration has been used to correct the atmospheric WV. The Superiority of
