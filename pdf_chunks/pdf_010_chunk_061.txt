with innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) for the estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that 1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. 2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. 3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging clouds. 4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a convective system. 5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and thus effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during day time). 6. The humidity and total precipitable water as a background field characterizes the rainfall process identification. 7. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the associated instantaneous rain rate can be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain rate for cloud top brightness temperature using Satellite Passive Microwave Radiometer (e.g. TRMM-TMI) and/or Active Microwave Radar (TRMM-PR). 8. Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. 9. Production of rainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and above grid spacing. Several such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using measurements from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is common for GPI algorithm. In addition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images is being presented here in brief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with thicker clouds the probability
