the SW algorithm is working fairly well. However, for some of the daytime 3D-LST retrievals (e.g. 05:30 GMT), an unambiguous over estimation was observed as compared to MOD-LST retrievals. This overestimation in 3D-LST is apparent at all the LST values independent of low or high values in the daytime. Reasons of this overestimation in 3D LST could be: use of India-specific atmospheric profiles in present study for the RT modelling to obtain better tuning of the SW coefficients, difference in the algorithms used, difference in the spatial resolution, difference in time of data acquisition, ignorance of the reflectance term (3rd term of equation 1) in the simulation of at-sensor radiance. This reflectance term is quite small since it is multiplied with the downwelling radiance, atmospheric transmittivity and (1- emissivity) components. But probably with the presence of solar radiation it may play an important role, which has to be checked in future analysis. Moreover, there are certain issues like cloud masking remain in the present LST retrieval. At many instances in the present analysis, thresholding method for cloud masking does not perform well especially over snow regions. A robust cloud-mask algorithm has to be devised and applied to get accurate LST products. 18.7 Conclusions This document presents results of a study to develop a method to generate LST product from the thermal infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager sensor over India using a RT model. A modified split-window algorithm including the view angle correction was developed specifically tuned for the Imager sensor. Simulations were carried out based upon a number of model inputs to derive a set of coefficients from the atmospheric functions particularly tuned for the Imager sensor. These SW coefficients were then used to generate the LST product. The total theoretical modelling error ranged from 0.8 K (for view zenith
