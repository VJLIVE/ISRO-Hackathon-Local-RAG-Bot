The 3-days, 12-14 Oct. 2013, Orissa state averaged rain associated with the Phaillin cyclone from INSAT-3D H-E, surface observations, TRMM-3B42RT and CPC is provided in Table 1. Table 1: Orissa state averaged rain associated with Phaillin cyclone from 12-14 Oct. 2013. Rain (mm) H-E Surface Obs. 3B41RT CPC 125.89 110.1 60.0 180.0 Thus it can be concluded that INSAT-3D H-E rain is not only in a good qualitatively and quantitatively agreement with surface observations but it is also having a good agreement in its spatial distribution. Further, we have compared weekly meteorological (met) subdivision averaged rain from INSAT-3D H-E with corresponding rain values from IMD generated weekly weather reports (WWR) and TRMM-3B42RT for 7 weeks from 29 May to 16 July 2014 of the S- W monsoon season. The Fig. 5 shows the inter-comparison of weekly met-subdivision averaged rain from H-E, WWR and 3B42RT. The Fig. 5 shows a reasonably good agreement of H-E weekly rain with IMD WWR and TRMM-3B42RT. To examine the comparison statistics of H-E rain in better perspective, we have provided the comparison of 3B42RT with IMD WWR. It may be recalled that 3B42RT is an IR and microwave merged product. Further comparison is made between hourly CPC 1oX1o latitude-longitude gridded rain with H-E rain for period from 23-27 October 2013. The comparison
