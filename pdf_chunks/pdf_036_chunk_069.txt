level anomaly (SLA), also referred to as Residual Sea Surface, is defined here as the sea surface height minus the mean sea surface and minus known geophysical effects, namely tidal and inverse barometer. It is given by: Sea Level Anomaly = Sea Surface Height - Mean Sea Surface - Solid Earth Tide Height - Geocentric Ocean Tide Height - Pole Tide Height - Inverted Barometer Height Correction - HF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography The SLA contains information about: · Real changes in ocean topography related to ocean currents · Dynamic response to atmospheric pressure · Differences between tides and the tide models · Differences between the mean sea surface model and the true mean sea surface at the SARAL/AltiKa location · Unmodeled or mismodeled measurement effects (skewness, sea state bias, altimeter errors, tropospheric corrections, ionospheric correction, etc.) · Orbit errors There is naturally also random measurement noise. Understanding the first four items as a function of space and time is the purpose of SARAL/AltiKa. Altitude : Orbit altitude (see parameter altitude) Corrected Range : See section 4.2.1. Tide effects (solid earth tide height, geocentric ocean tide height, pole tide height) : See sections 4.2.2.1 and 5.9. Inverted Barometer Height Correction : SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 49 Use inv_bar_corr (see also section 5.10). HF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography : Use hf_fluctuations_corr (see also section 5.10). Mean Sea Surface : See sections 4.2.2.2 and 5.4. 4.2.2.1. Tide Effects The total tide effect on the sea surface height is the sum of three values from the (O)(I)GDR: Tide Effect = Geocentric Ocean Tide + Solid Earth Tide + Pole Tide (See also section 5.9 and subsections) Geocentric Ocean Tide : The geocentric ocean tide provided on the (O)(I)GDR is actually the sum
