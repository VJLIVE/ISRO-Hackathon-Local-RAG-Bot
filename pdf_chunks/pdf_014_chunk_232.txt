be equal to 1.0. This assumption should cause errors within acceptable limits i.e., ≤ 0.02 in reflectance units in the retrieved MIR reflectance. We would try and incorporate more appropriate values of emissivities and transmittivities in the subsequent version of the algorithms. Emissivity/Temperature discrimination is not attempted in the present implementation. 16.8 Future Scope Correction for the emission component and out of band correction in a more accurate manner would be attempted.
