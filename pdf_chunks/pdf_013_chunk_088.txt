the surface shortwave radiation budget (SRB) over Tropical Ocean and to assess its impact on the climate change. The tropical oceans with SST usually greater than 28 °C, forms a major part of the largest warm pool on the earth. The variations of surface insolation over these warm pool regions are primarily due to the variations in cloudiness which are manifestation of deep convection [Shinoda et al., 1998; Sengupta et al., 2001]. The long-term surface measurements of radiative fluxes are limited primarily to the continental regions [Ohmura and Gilgen, 1991]. The satellite estimates of cloudiness and top of the atmosphere fluxes have been used in conjunction with radiative transfer models to produce global estimates of SRB over land and ocean [Li, 1995; Rossow and Zhang, 1995; Whitlock et al., 1995; Gupta et al., 1997]. The most popular algorithms used in computing INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 78 SRB estimates from satellite data are described by Pinker and Laszlo [1992] and Darnell et al. [1992]. The global Analysis, such as the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) [Kalnay et al., 1996], National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Data Assimilation Office (NASA/DAO) [Schubert et al., 1993], and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis [ERA, 1999] projects have provided climate researchers with alternative estimates of the earth’s SRB. Bony et al. [1997] used data from the NASA/DAO and NCEP reanalysis for the period 1987– 88 to compare SWR at the surface to satellite estimates in the Tropics (30°S–30°N). They found the annual mean bias in NCEP SWR over the tropical ocean ranging from -10 to -30 W m-2, while NASA/DAO SWR biases ranged from -50 W m-2 in subsidence regions of the subtropics to -25 W m-2 in convective regions near the equator.
