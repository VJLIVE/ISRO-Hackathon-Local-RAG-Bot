several factors related to land surface and the atmosphere over large regional scales. Thus, they have high potential in calculating land surface and water cycle at hourly temporal resolution. This shows the vital role of geostationary satellite in modelling Evapotranspiration on spatial scale. Operational ET INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 47 products are available over US and Europe using thermal remote sensing data from geostationary meteorological satellite data such as GOES (Anderson et al, 2007) and MSG-SEVIRI (Hu et al, 2015). 4.2.1. Overview and background Most of the methods used for modelling evapotranspiration uses energy surface balance framework using thermal infrared remote sensing. This describes the heat and water transfer from land surface to overlying atmosphere within surface layer of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) : Rn- G = H + λE (1) Where, Rn is the net surface radiation, G is the soil heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux and λE is the latent heat flux. Remote sensing technique can provide spatial and temporal information of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), surface albedo, surface emissivity, and radiometric surface temperature, most of which are indispensable to the models and methods that partition the available energy (Li et. al. 2009 , Mauser et.al. 1998). A large number of efforts have been made to incorporate remotely sensed surface temperature in combination with other critical variables, e.g., NDVI and albedo into ET modeling during the past three decades (kala et.al. 2008). It was Penman (Penman 1948) who laid the foundation for relating evapotranspiration to meteorological variables (Allen et.al. 1998). Model simulations or empirical equations requiring meteorological data are the traditional way of estimating evapotranspiration such as gradient method, Bowen ratio method, eddy covariance method, lysimeter method. Malamos et.al. (2015) used PM method to estimate ET on the
