modifies the air mass characteristics. Presence of air mass lightens the air mass thereby increasing the potential for convective activity. As an air parcel rises, it cools dry adiabatically until saturation vapor pressure is reached. Once saturation vapor pressure is reached some of the water vapor condenses forming liquid droplets, and releasing latent heat. This latent heating reduces the amount of cooling and makes the air parcel more buoyant. This information is very essential for accurate prediction of weather and goes as an input parameter in numerical weather prediction models. 2.2.2 Objective To compute layer precipitable water in three layers i.e. 1000hPa-900 hPa, 900-700 hPa, and 700-300 hPa and total precipitable water in the vertical column of atmosphere stretching from surface to about 100 hPa. 2.3 Inputs 2.3.1 Dynamic data Retrieved specific humidity at standard pressure levels. Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 370 2.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 2.4.1 Theoretical Background Layer precipitable water may be computed using the formula dp g q PW p p  2 1 where p1 and p2 are bounding pressures of each layer in Pa, q – specific humidity in Kg/Kg. Total precipitable water is also computed from the same formula with p1 as surface pressure and p2 as top of the atmosphere pressure (i.e. about 100 hPa beyond which water vapor amount is assumed to be in negligible). Unit of precipitable water is mm depth of equal amount of liquid water above a surface of one square meter (if pressure is in Pa and specific humidity is in Kg/Kg). 2.4.2 Operational Implementation For practical purposes the above integral is evaluated numerically i.e. integral expression is replaced by summation. p g q PW p p p    2 1 2.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution
