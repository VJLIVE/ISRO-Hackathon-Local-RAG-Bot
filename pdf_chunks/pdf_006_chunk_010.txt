The new concept included here is to determine the threshold on the basis of clear sky temperature determined by compositing the multi-date image data. 2.4.1.1 Theoretical Background The theoretical basis of the algorithms and practical considerations are contained in this section. For nomenclature, we shall refer to the infrared radiance as brightness temperature (equivalent blackbody temperature determined using the Planck function) denoted as BT. Subscripts refer to the wavelength at which the measurement is made. Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the underlying earth surface. Simple visible and infrared window threshold approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection; however, many surface conditions reduce cloud surface contrast in certain spectral regions, (e.g. bright clouds over snow and ice). 2.4.1.2 Infrared Brightness Temperature Thresholds and Difference (BTD) Tests The azimuthally averaged form of the infrared radiative transfer equation is given by (1) In addition to atmospheric structure, which determines B(T), the parameters describing the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere are the single scattering albedo, ω0 =
