IR window channels (10.5-11.5μ and 11.5-12.5 μ). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived AMV and INSAT-3D/3DR IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 14.2.1. Overview and background The availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic and region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated us to re-look further for the improvement in retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason for this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of winds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. For example, INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 151 if INSAT-3D captured image at 0000 UTC, then INSAT-3DR does at 0015 UTC and similar nomenclature follows for other time of the day. The operational meteorological parameters derived using INSAT-3DR are same as that of INSAT-3D, with 15 minute time gap. In both the satellites, spectrum of the atmosphere is covered by six imager channels i.e. the Visible (VIS), Short-wave infrared (SWIR), Mid-wave infrared (MIR), Water vapor (WV) and two split window thermal infrared (TIR1 and TIR2) channels. The image registration accuracy significantly improved because of star sensors are present on both the satellites. The individual INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived every 30-minute intervals. As an example, the INSAT-3D AMVs are retrieved at 0000, 0030, 0100 UTC, while INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived at 0015, 0045, 0115 UTC respectively. The AMV derived from these satellites are widely accepted by different national and international operational agencies. In the present study, the algorithm for deriving AMVs using infrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode
