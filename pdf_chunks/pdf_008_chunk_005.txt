and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 (Vicente et al. 1998). The A-E method provides same relationship for core and non-core precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value for core rain and is hereafter referred as (Rc). In H-E, the rain is determined by the cloud growth at the given pixel relative to the surrounding pixels. The H-E method ensures heavier rain for growing clouds, in the upwind portion of the storm with overshooting tops. The core and non-core fractions of the precipitation are identified and different R-Tb relationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the convective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and b are dynamic in nature, and which depends upon available TPW as provided by National Centre for Environmental Predictions (NCEP/NOAA) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model derived fields. This allows higher precipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained with precipitation value of 0.5 mm h-1 at Tb =240 K, and a precipitable water (from NCEP model) dependent value at Tb =210 K. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain at any pixel is limited depending upon availability of TPW. This allows the maximum precipitation as a function of available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm/h is restricted to 40 times the precipitable water in inches. If a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In principle, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity. For a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb
