channels of INSAT-3D imager. Algorithm is developed using two basic approaches: i. First approach (ALG-1) uses RTM simulated INSAT-3D radiances and OLR ii. Second approach (ALG-2) uses simultaneously measured CERES OLR and INSAT- 3D radiances 3.3 Inputs 3.3.1 Image and pre-processing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Gray count values of WV channel Pixel 10 bit DP (data processing) Gray count values of TIR-1 channel Pixel 10 bit - DP Gray count values of TIR-2 channel Pixel 10 bit - DP Coefficients for conversion of Gray value to radiances - - - DP Geolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel DP 3.3.2 Other Auxiliary data and Model Input To develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR using radiative transfer approach (ALG-1), a large database of the atmospheric profiles of temperature (T), pressure, water vapor (q), and ozone (O3) concentrations are required. These profiles are extracted from the TIGR-3 database (Chevallier, Che´din, Che´ruy, & Morcrette, 2000), which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected among a larger set of worldwide soundings. Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone from ECMWF are taken. Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 33 To develop the empirical relation between narrowband radiances and OLR using second approach (ALG-2), the Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) OLR product derived from the broadband observations by the CERES (on board Terra and Aqua) and FY-2D measured radiances (proxy for INSAT-3D) are used.
