of brightness temperature difference of least and most affected channels with rain rate. Fig 6 (b) shows the variation of brightness temperature difference (Tb) with rain rate (mm/h), which is exponential in nature. We follow the same procedure on land also, and the exponential relation holds well over land too, with different pairs of coefficients. A similar relationship is observed for all other scan locations over land and oceans. For rain retrieval algorithm, we use the SAPHIR and PR collocated dataset as referred in the previous section. First, for each of the scan positions, we separate the data over land and ocean and then divided them further into two parts - rainy and no rainy. We, however, use only rainy pixels and referred this dataset as a training data set. As discussed above, from radiative transfer simulations, we find an exponential relationship between rain rate and the difference of brightness temperatures measured at S1 and S2. We thus use the following form of the equation for ocean and land and for each pixel location, b T * c e * b a R    (1) Where, R is rain rate in (mm/h), a, b and c are regression coefficients. We calculate the values of a, b and c for separately over land and oceans and at each of the pixel locations. In order to define the accuracy of the rain estimation algorithm, we apply rain identification algorithm and the eq. (1) to the training dataset of collocated SAPHIR and PR observations of rainy pixels and calculate rain rate from SAPHIR observations at each pixel location and compared with the PR rain rates. This provides a correlation of 8 0.70, rms error of 0.81 mm/h and bias of 0.04 mm/h for total number of observations of about 0.94 million.
