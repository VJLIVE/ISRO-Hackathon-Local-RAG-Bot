of cloud from the clear sky is necessary for many geophysical parameter retrieval from INSAT data. Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the underlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. However, there are many surface conditions when this characterization of clouds is inappropriate, most notably over snow and ice. Additionally, some cloud types such as thin cirrus, low stratus at night, and small cumulus are difficult to detect because of insufficient contrast with the surface radiance. Cloud edges cause further difficulty since the instrument field of view will not always be completely cloudy or clear. INSAT-3D VHRR will measure radiances in one visible and one SWIR band at 1 km spatial resolution, one MIR and two TIR bands at 4 km resolution, and one WV band at 8 km resolution. Radiances from 3 IR spectral bands TIR –1 , TIR –2 and MIR (Table 1) which are of same resolution of 4km are used in the INSAT cloud mask algorithm to estimate whether a given view of the earth surface is unobstructed by clouds. This cloud mask parameter will be directly used for the retrieval of the following parameters: SST , UTH, Fire and Snow Cover. This will be partially used for retrieval of AOD where additional test may be required with the visible data. 2.2.1 Overview and background The INSAT cloud mask algorithm benefits from several previous efforts to characterize global cloud cover using satellite observations. These algorithms have been used in global cloud climatology over long time periods and thus have overcome some of the difficulties facing the INSAT cloud mask algorithm. A wide variety of scientists have discussed the physical basis behind each of the spectral tests and applications to satellite
