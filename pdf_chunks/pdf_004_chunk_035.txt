through equation (20). The impact of rain is observed in terms of drastic changes in retrieved wind speed and direction as shown in figures (15). The retrieved wind speed 30 below and above 15 m/s are over- and under- estimated, respectively as seen in figure (15a), while retrieved directions are aligned towards direction normal to sub-satellite track as observed in figure (15b). These observed characteristics under rainy conditions are utilized to flag the retrievals under rainy situations as mentioned subsequently.

This needs rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged). Under very low intensity rain situations, winds can be retrieved with due corrections to backscatter through simultaneous retrieval of wind and rain using MLE (Draper and Long 2004a). Presently, only rain flagging of data using NSD algorithm has been attempted following the approach by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success rates for rain-free and rainy conditions. For rain flagging, the NSD values under rain-free and rainy situations have been compared keeping the observed behavior of the derived wind vectors in view. Rain rates from 0 to 50 km.mm/hr with an interval of 10 km.mm/hr are considered. The trends of variation of rank-1 SD values under rain-free and rainy conditions as shown in figure (16a) are found to be separable, hence, can be used for rain flagging. The SD values for rain-free and under low to moderate rain conditions are overlapping which primarily lead to such rain events undetected. However, apart from this, another useful clue used here is that the retrieved wind directions under rainy situations are mostly found to be around directions normal to
