the synoptic evolution that is important for weather and climate prediction. OLR is a major component of the Earth’s Radiation Budget, which drives the atmospheric circulation, particularly over the tropics. This is mainly due to the fact that in the tropics, the OLR is largely modulated by cloudiness. In particular, it varies with cloud top temperature and consequently, low radiation values indicate the major convective system. Generally, values less than 250 Wm-2 would give a good indication of the cloudiness over the tropics. The observations of OLR by earth orbiting satellites have been made from the beginning of the environmental satellite program. Besides the broadband instruments that are dedicated for observing the OLR, for example, Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), Scanner Radiometer for Radiation Budget (ScaRab), and Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), there are many algorithms that estimate OLR by converting the narrowband radiance observations into broadband flux (4–100 µm). The OLR was routinely obtained from the 10–12 µm window on operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellite beginning in 1974 (Gruber and Winston, 1978). Early operational estimation of OLR employed a simple parameterization using the window channel brightness temperature of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA 6–7 (Ellingson and Ferraro, 1983; Gruber and Krueger, 1984). New algorithms were developed in subsequent years to improve the accuracy of the OLR. Ellingson et al. (1989) have shown that the linear combination of only four (6.6– 6.9 µm; 7.9–8.5 µm; 13.1–13.6 µm; 14.3–14.7 µm) High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) channels could account for more than 99% of the OLR total variance. Comparison with the ERBE (Ellingson et al., 1994) instrument flown in NOAA 9–11 satellites suggested that estimates made with HIRS data exhibited errors of the same order as the estimated accuracy of ERBE (5
