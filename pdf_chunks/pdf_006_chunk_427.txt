from Kalpana-1 VHRR were obtained for 0330, 0500, 0530, 0600, 0630, 0700, 0730, 0800, 0830, 1130 for 1 to 15 October 2013 were obtained through MOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). The mean insolation from diurnal instances of Kalpana-1 VHRR was compared with mean insolation from ‘Imager’. A comparison was made between insolation estimates averaged over 3 x 3 pixels (~ 12 km x 12 km) and in situ point measurements from Agro-Met Station (AMS) at coincident timings during 1 to 15 October 2013. There was significant correlation (r = 0.72) between these two from 90 paired datasets (Figure 6). This showed a mean bias of 37 Wm-2 and RMSE of the order of 16.8% of measured mean from AMS. The RMSE has been reduced substantially as compared to reported RMSE (25%) of instantaneous insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR estimates averaged over 64 km x 64 km and with respect to AMS- based point measurements. The scatter of points around 1:1 line could be due to differences in scale mismatch between estimates and measurements leading to loss of sub-pixel cloud heterogeneity. A qualitative comparison (Figure 7) was made between ‘Imager’ and VHRR insolation for 0730 GMT on 13 October 2013 to look into the impact of better resolution (0.04 deg) of ‘Imager’ on insolation specially in cloudy patches.
