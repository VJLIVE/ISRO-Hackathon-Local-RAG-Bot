to establish validity of this observation, the similar investigations were carried out from December to May at an interval of one month. The NDSI threshold will be fine tuned after the availability of INSAT 3D derived snow cover product. 6.4.2 Operational Implementation 6.4.1.2 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: In this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D data. The radiometrically processed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and geometrically corrected product to be used further in algorithm. 6.4.1.3 Step 2 : Cloud elimination This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D image. Cloud screening is based on temperature data/or cloud mask along with cloud removal using SWIR threshold value, and will help to clear cloudy pixels. 6.4.1.4 Step 3 : Generation of NDSI image Normalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio of visible and SWIR channel as given below; NDSI = (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) / (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) Where R is the reflectance of the respective channel. 6.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution SCM Km2 - - - Pixel level 6.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Geolocated Snow map & Areal extent of snow cover in Himalayan region. Snow cover INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 109 6.6 Validation and Error Analysis 6.6.1 Validation Activities 6.6.1.1 Comparison of INSAT 3D snow maps with AWiFS and MODIS operational snow maps INSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by AWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap results with these independently-produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified
