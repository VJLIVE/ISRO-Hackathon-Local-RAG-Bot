Validation results A. Daily scale Daily ETo estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ETo computed from AMS measurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot is shown in Figure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ETo computed from AMS varied from 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ETo varied from 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different seasons for selected stations. The error analysis showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) varied from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the tune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table 7). The overall pooled data set showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured mean. This was due to high fluctuation of ETo on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all six AMS stations. The estimated daily ETo showed underestimation as well as overestimation for all AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations.
