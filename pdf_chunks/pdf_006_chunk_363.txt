The different derivatives of the Ts given by Eq. (5) were calculated. Values of e(Ti)= e(Tj) = 0.1 K and e(i) = e(j) = 0.002 have been considered for the present study. These selected values are considered to be representative of typical errors when working in remote sensing. The results on the error and sensitivity analysis obtained for each view angle are summarized in table 4, which includes the contribution to the total error of the different terms (alg, NET, and ) and the total error in LST, e(LST). The errors on LST have been calculated by applying Eq. (5-7) to each of the thousands of simulated data points. Table 4: Results obtained in the sensitivity analysis View angle Sub range alg (K)
