atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each Field of Regard (FOR) are plotted with the calculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximates the observed surface and cloud conditions. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 104 Fig 1: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al., 1993) By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and it involves ten steps. These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al. (1993) and Nieman et al. (1997). Calculated water vapor radiances can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the above equation (2). When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as the
