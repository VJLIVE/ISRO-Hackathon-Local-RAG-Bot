than 0.5K accuracy, one should opt other atmospheric WV correction techniques as used in ATSR mission which gives approximately 0.3K (Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1988; Barton, et al., 1993) errors in retrieved SST. In ATSR dual- view configuration has been used to correct the atmospheric WV. The Superiority of the dual-view SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 10 algorithm over single-view split-window algorithm lies in the fact that use of the cleaner window for atmospheric correction using second view with larger path-length reduces the uncertainty that arises in the split window algorithm due to larger uncertainties in the attenuation in the second split-window channel due to highly variable atmospheric water vapor. 3.2 Algorithm Flowchart Fig. 3: Flow-chart of SST Retrieval from INSAT-3DR Imager SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 11 3.3 Operational Implementation The implementation is done in the following steps: Step-1. Reading of the grey counts, geolocation, satellite and solar zenith angles. Step-2. Determine brightness temperatures from grey counts using the lookup table. Step-3. Mask the land pixels using land/sea mask. Step-4. Processing for discrimination between brightness temperatures from cloud free sea surface and those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 3.1.3. Step-5. Computation of SST For cloud-free pixels, SST is computed as 𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) (a0= 15.3364, a1= 0.9535, a2=- 0.8215, a3= 0.0072, a4=0.5144 for INSAT-3DR) (a0= 15.8150, a1= 0.9519, a2=- 0.8544, a3= 0.0075, a4=0.5340 for INSAT-3D) where, a’s and b’s are the retrieval coefficients, T1, T2 and T3 are the brightness temperatures of TIR-1, TIR-2. Tsfc has been taken from the daily SST climatology. Step-6. Quality control/Editing of derived SST Only those SST values will be retained for which the following condition holds: (𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚−3𝜎) ≤𝑆𝑆𝑇≤(𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚+ 3𝜎) where, σ is the standard deviation of the daily climatological SST and SSTclim is the daily value
