Many ocean color sensors are looking at the ocean away from nadir to avoid sunglint making Rrs to be anisotropic in nature, having an angular distribution (Lee et al., 2004). Therefore, an inversion of satellite-derived reflectance with good accuracy using (1), specially for coastal waters, have always been a challenging task. 4.3 ABOM/ABOM2 Model Description The basic formalism of QAA (quasi-analytical model) by Lee et al. 2004 has been adopted in analytical bio optical model (ABOM) model which accounts for the cumulative response of angular distribution of light field and multiple scattering within the water column (due to molecular or particle scattering) on the Rrs. The semi-ABOM, similar to GSM, solves the closure relationship between Rrs and IOPs using Levenberg–Marquardt technique in a least square sense. Remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs), as mentioned earlier, is the function of two vectors θ and φ. The unknown vector θ = [chl, acdm(λ), bbp(λ)] is simultaneously derived after modification in known vector φ = [a∗ ph(λ1)..a∗ ph(λN ), S, η] parameterization. Set of equations used in ABOM model is summarized in equation 11 to 15. We have assumed that the absorption due to CDOM dominates over detritus absorption. We also corrected for the CDOM slope bias by introducing empirically derived expression for S (Fig. 3), details are presented in Section II-D. We also accounted for the variability in a∗ph
