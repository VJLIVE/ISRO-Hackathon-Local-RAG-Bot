Objective The main objective of this study is to derive the High Resolution Visible Winds (HRVIS) over sea using multiple successive half hourly High resolution visible images. The region over which the winds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point. 13.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 13.4.1. Tracer selection: At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater than 15° K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as
