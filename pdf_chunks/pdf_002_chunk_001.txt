Abstract: Megha-Tropiques satellite carries onboard a microwave sounder, SAPHIR, and a microwave radiometer, MADRAS, along with two other instruments. Due to currently non- functioning of MADRAS, the possibility of detection and estimation of rain from SAPHIR is explored. The SAPHIR operates in 6 frequencies ranging from 183.310.2 to 183.3111 GHz which are close to water vapor absorption line at 183.31 GHz. In the first step, an examination of the rain effect on SAPHIR channels is carried out, and the results showed them to be sensitive to the rain. In the second step, a rain identification algorithm is attempted, which is based on average rain probability (PR) measured at SAPHIR channels. The effect of false alarm and missing rain is examined and it is found that missing rain over land and ocean is < 0.9 mm/h and 0.13 mm/h with standard deviation of 0.70 mm/h and 0.54 mm/h, respectively, and rain due to false alarm over both land and oceans is < 0.9 mm/h. In the third step, a nonlinear rain retrieval algorithm is proposed for rain affected pixels, which explains
