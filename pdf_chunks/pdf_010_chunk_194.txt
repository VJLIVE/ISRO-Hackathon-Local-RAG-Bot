Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi- directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first- generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area of 32 X 32 IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper- level cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the infrared channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is coarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a template) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we used 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:    i j I j i I a ) , ( (1) Where  j i I ,
