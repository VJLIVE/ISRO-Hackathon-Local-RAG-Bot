amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS snow maps. The accuracy of the snow maps will vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snowmap algorithm has been and will continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined from field measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the expected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm. 6.2 Introduction 6.2.1 Overview and background The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days snow covered digital map products will be generated. Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow during wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can affect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et Snow cover INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 102 al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important parameter for various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche investigation. Snow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, the potential for operational satellite-based mapping
