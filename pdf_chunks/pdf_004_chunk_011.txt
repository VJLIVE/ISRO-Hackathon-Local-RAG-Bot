Hence, these GMFs are required to be redeveloped or refined for an independently designed scatterometer system. 4.2 GMF development procedures: After normalization with the constant term, the equation (1), considering variations in radar backscatter up to third harmonic of wind direction, is rewritten as 0 = A0[1+A1.cos (ϕ)+ A2.cos (2ϕ)+ A3.cos (3ϕ)] 1a where, the coefficients Ai are functions of wind speed, incidence angle and polarization. In order to determine the coefficient A0 at desired incidence angle, wind speed and polarization, the σ0 values for all relative wind direction ϕ varying from 0 to 2π are averaged yielding A0 coefficient as the summation of Cos(ϕ), Cos(2ϕ) and Cos(3ϕ) vanishes A0 = <σ0> 2 Dividing equation (1a) by A0 on both sides and rearranging the terms we get 8 Y = A1 Cos(ϕ) + A2 Cos(2ϕ)+ A3 Cos(3ϕ) where Y = (σ0/A0)–1 3 At desired incidence angle, polarization and wind speed, by determining Y at each ϕ value, the harmonic coefficients Ai are established through statistical analysis. This procedure yields the GMF coefficients as well as an idea about the scatterometer data quality. It
