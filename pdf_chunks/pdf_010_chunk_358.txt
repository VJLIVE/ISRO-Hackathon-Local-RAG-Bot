al. 1999) was selected for the study because this model has been long publicly available and its heritage traces back to LOWTRAN (Kneizys et al. 1988). It is widely used and validated model for variety of remote sensing analysis and applications across the globe. It uses a more accurate and higher resolution molecular band model based on the Atlas of High Resolution Molecular Spectroscopic data (HITRAN) molecular database. With its spectral resolution capability of 2 cm−1, this narrowband model can perform calculations very accurately with less input requirements as discussed by Lacis and Oinas (1991) and Liang (2004). They have shown that using two narrow spectral ranges of H2O and CO2 (for a resolution of 10 cm−1, and for total gas pressures above 0.1 atm), the correlation accuracy can be improved to better than 1%. With its spectral resolution capability of cm-1 in frequency it simulates at-sensor radiance and transmittance as a function of: atmospheric inputs (model atmosphere, atmospheric Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 290 column parameters, aerosol model etc), surface inputs (emissivity, temperature), viewing geometry and information on spectral channels. 18.4.3 Data used in the study Various data sets have been used in the present study for generation and validation of LST from the INSAT-3D Imager data. This includes the raw Imager data sets (at-sensor brightness temperature, latitude-longitude layers), MODIS emissivity products in two spectral channels, K1-LST products and MODIS-LST products. The K1-LST and MODIS-LST products were used for comparing the LST images being generated from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor using the proposed method. Table 2 summarizes the data sets used in the present study with their details.
