point measurements over land & oceans Fast Response Rain Gauge From IMD at all DWR locations (every 1-3 hours) 0.250 x 0.250 Doppler Weather Radar Source Resolution Parameter Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 24 The level 1a and level 1b products are required for above-mentioned approaches for the rainfall retrievals. The database created in an offline process will act as a tool for the algorithm development. During the initial six months of calibration- validation phase the knowledge of the noise characteristics of the different horizontal and vertical polarization channels will be applied for the improvement of the algorithm. This period will also help in creating a database of ground-based networks like rain gages, Automatic Weather Stations and Doppler Weather Radars in consistency with the MADRAS observations for the empirical algorithm development. The satellite overpasses in and around DWR and rain gauge sites will be utilized for the validation purposes. One complete iteration of TRMM rainfall validation campaign was exercised using the SHAR and IMD DWR at Chennai (Gairola et al. 2004) in a compaign mode. TRMM radar and radiometric observations of rainfall were compared with DWR on various grid scales. This needs to be augmented during the Megha-Tropiques time frame using all the five DWRs in the country, AWS and the fast response rain gauges. The error statistics will be generated with a possible feedback mechanism to correct for some biases etc. to make the algorithm more robust. 2.9 Technical Issues For the instantaneous rainfall error there are some major sources of error: 1) Availability of Cloud resolving model simulations 2) Coastal boundaries. 3) Beam Filling Error 4) Vertical distribution of Hydrometeors 5) The freezing level retrieval These error sources are very critical and needs to be followed with active groups working at various places elsewhere (in country or abroad). 2.10
