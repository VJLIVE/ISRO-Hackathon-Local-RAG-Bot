GLOBAL ANALYSED OCEAN SURFACE WIND PRODUCTS Description The analysed winds have been generated at 0.50×0.50 interval over the global oceans. For the generation of these analysed winds products, we have used (Oceansat-2 SCATterometer) OSCAT data for daily Analysed Wind Vector (AWV) and combined OSCAT and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard MetOP-A data for generating 12 hourly AWV. Along with wind vector and wind stress, other parameters of interest, wind divergence and vertical component of curl of wind stress have also been computed and provided. OSCAT was launched by the ISRO on 23rd September 2009 carrying a Ku band (13.515 GHz) pencil beam scatterometer along with two other payloads (Ocean Color Monitor, OCM and Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies, ROSA) into a near polar sun-synchronous orbit of 720 km altitude, inclination 98.250 and the local time of equatorial crossing in the descending node at 12 noon ± 10 minutes. The scatterometer (OSCAT) has a repeat cycle of 2-days at incidence angles 48.90 (HH- polarization) and 57.60 (VV-polarization) and the corresponding swaths are 1400 km and 1840 km respectively with a nominal spatial resolution of 50 km. In present study, we have used well Level- 2B (L2B) operational wind products (version 1.3, October 2011) from OSCAT available freely from National Remote Sensing Centre (www.nrsc.gov.in). ASCAT as one of the payloads onboard first Meteorological Operational Platform (MetOP-A), was launched by EUMETSAT on 19th October 2006. The ASCAT is a C-band (5.3 GHz) fan beam scatterometer with six fan beam antennas providing two swaths 550km wide, located on each side of the satellite track, separated by a nadir gap of 700 km. For operational generation of AWV products, L2B data (with 25 km resolution) of ASCAT provided by EUMETSAT’s broadcast system for environmental data (EUMETCAST) are being used.
