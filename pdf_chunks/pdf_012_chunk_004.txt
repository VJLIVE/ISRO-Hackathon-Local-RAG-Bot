Algorithm Functional Specifications 3.1 Overview 3.1.1 Theoretical Background Radiance from Earth’s terrestrial emission peaks at around 10 m and it has minimum attenuation by atmospheric gases. Hence in order to measure earth’s surface temperature, space borne sensors are designed around this band (8-12m). Still this band is not completely transparent. Atmospheric water vapour and CO2 are the major constituents that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of the atmosphere in this wavelength band. Since CO2 is a uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be taken care, but water vapour being highly variable in space and time needs additional information on total water content in the atmosphere (directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea surface SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 6 temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires atmospheric correction arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This correction is more in tropics during summer due to higher amount of atmospheric moisture loading (Barton 1983, Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). The radiative transfer simulation studies, carried out using diverse training profiles set, have shown that with proper characterization of water vapour in the atmosphere, a suitable algorithm can be developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal window and mid IR thermal channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K (Fig.2). The simplest of such algorithms assume that, for small cumulative amounts of water vapour, the atmosphere is sufficiently optically thin that the difference between the measured temperature in any band and the true surface temperature can be parameterized as a simple function of the difference between the measured temperatures in two bands with different atmospheric transmissions.
