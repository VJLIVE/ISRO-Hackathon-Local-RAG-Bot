1 shows the spectral response functions of TIR channels of INSAT-3D Imager. The INSAT-3D satellite views the Earth’s globe from its location of 84 degree East on the equator. The view zenith angle for INSAT-3D satellite from this particular location was computed by the method developed by Pandya & Dadhwal (1999) and its pattern over India and surroundings is shown in the figure 2. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 10 10.2 10.4 10.6 10.8 11 11.2 11.4 11.6 Relative Spectral Response Wavelength, m 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 11.2 11.4 11.6 11.8 12 12.2 12.4 12.6 12.8 Relative Spectral Response Wavelength, m (a) (b) Figure 1.

View zenith angle for the INSAT-3D satellite located at 84 degree E To derive LST from various satellite-based sensors several types of split-window (SW) algorithms have been developed during past three decades; however, SW algorithm for Indian sensor has not been attempted. This document presents a theoretical base study that was carried out to develop a SW algorithm for LST retrieval using TIR observations from the INSAT-3D Imager. 18.3 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Thermal infrared signal received by satellite sensors is combination of three parameters, namely; (1) surface temperature and surface emissivity, (2) atmospheric emission, absorption and scattering acting upon thermal radiation from the surface, and (3) the solar radiation during daytime. In the absence of atmosphere, estimation of LST of the Earth’s surface would be much simpler task. On the other hand, the presence of Earth’s atmosphere between the satellite and the surface changes the surface emitted radiances measured by the satellite sensor in several
