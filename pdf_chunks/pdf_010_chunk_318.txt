For each sounder pixel, a cloud detection algorithm is to be applied to get the clear/cloudy index. Various cloud-detection schemes are developed and implemented for infrared sounders (Smith et al. 1979; McMillen and Dean 1982; Hayden 1988). Each pixel undergoes several tests for clear/cloudy identifications:  During daytime if visible channel#19 count is greater then a threshold, then the pixel is considered cloudy.  If longwave window channel (channel#8, 11.0m) brightness temperature is too cold (< 250) then the pixel is classified cloudy.  If the longwave window brightness temperature is 4 K cooler than that of the warmest pixel from 8 adjacent pixels, then this pixel is classified as cloudy.  Different window channels (thermal IR channels 8 and mid IR window channels 17, 18) have different transparency. After atmospheric correction to each channel, few checks are applied to classify the pixel as clear/cloudy. During daytime very high difference in channel 8 and 18 brightness temperature indicates presence of clouds. Thresholds for differences in different channels brightness temperature are to be determined by RT simulations. Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total
