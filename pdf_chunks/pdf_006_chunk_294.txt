points are excluded from further calculations. Cloudy pixels are identified and these pixels are also excluded from further calculations. The threshold used to eliminate the cloudy pixel is that if brightness temperature of thermal IR window channel is less than or equal to 270 and if the UTH calculated at that pixel is > 110 then it is a cloudy pixel, and hence eliminated. In the 5 x 5 pixel box, if the number of cloudy pixels is more than 75 % than the whole box is considered as cloudy and excluded from UTH retrieval. 15.4.2.3 Step 3: Zenith angle calculation: After the cloudy pixels are discarded then the zenith angle is calculated for the pixels using Equation (3). 15.4.2.4 Step 4 : UTH retrieval: Using the above calculated zenith angle and the UTH coefficients for corresponding satellite and month of the observation, UTH is calculated from Equation (2) using the water vapour channel brightness temperature. UTH is generated for every 5 x 5 pixel box. 15.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution UTH % 0 100 5 % (RMSE) 0.5° X 0.5° 15.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Binary file giving details of the time and location of the retrieval, zenith angle, % of clear pixels used in averaging within 5 x 5 pixel box, and UTH (%).
