estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid scales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm. 4.3 Inputs 4.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) The details for the required satellite data for both GPI and IMSRA are provided in following table: Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-1 channel (10.5) pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-2 channel (11.5) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of VIS channel pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of , WV channel (6.7) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of 3.9 mm pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Geolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP using Calibration Table 4.3.2 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs In addition to satellite data from INSAT-3D, radar and rain gauge data, and atmospheric moisture products (integrated precipitable water and relative humidity from 500-mb surface) obtained from the IMD/Eta Model analysis are essential on required grid spacing in different temporal scales. The gridded rainfall data from Doppler Weather Radars are needed from Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 50 IMD at every one hourly time interval on 1x1 and 0.25x0.25 deg grid resolution for GPI and IMSRA techniques. The rainfall from DWRs should be well calibrated and the products should be well converted to rain rate using an appropriate Z-R relation well tested and validated over Indian
