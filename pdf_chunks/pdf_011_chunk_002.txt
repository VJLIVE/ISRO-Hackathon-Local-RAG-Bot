Imager channels’ characteristics Band# (Name) Wavelength(μm) Resolution (km) SNR or NEDT (K) 1 (VIS) 0.52 – 0.72 1 150:1 2 (SWIR) 1.55 – 1.70 1 150:1 3 (MIR) 3.80 – 4.00 4 0.27 4 (WV) 6.50 – 7.00 8 0.18 5 (TIR1) 10.3 – 11.2 4 0.10 6 (TIR2) 11.5 – 12.5 4 0.25 Fig. 1: Convolved SRFs of infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager superimposed on IASI Tb spectra Sea surface temperature is derived from the split thermal window channels (10.3-11.2m, 11.5 – 12.5m) during daytime and using additional midwave-IR window channel (3.8 – 4.0 m) during nighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of the SST retrieval from IR observations is the atmospheric correction. Especially over tropics, this atmospheric correction is dominated by the high variability in vertical distribution of the intervening atmospheric water SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 4 vapor. This correction is determined through suitable characterization of tropical atmosphere in the radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D/3DR channels and then generating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have been given in section 3.1. 2.1 Overview and background This algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the current operational algorithm for the retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels data. While effort has been made to make this document as complete as possible, it should be recognized that algorithm development is an evolving process. This document (V1.1) is a description of the revised algorithm for INSAT-3D/3DR sea surface temperature estimation as it currently exists, and is being delivered for inclusion in the INSAT-3D/3DR processing scheme. Current research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the processes at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms.
