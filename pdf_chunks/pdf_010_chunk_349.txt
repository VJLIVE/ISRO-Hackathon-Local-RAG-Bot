challenging since the land surface is laterally inhomogeneous and is composed of various materials with different geometries. Surface temperatures are derived from satellite based measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR) window channels using either empirical method or physical algorithm. A number of Earth observation satellites such as EOS-MODIS, ASTER, AATSR, NOAA-AVHRR, Landsat ETM+, GOES-8, GOES-R, MSG-SEVIRI etc have TIR channels to derive LST. Various algorithms and coefficients have been developed for LST retrieval for these systems and reported in the literature over a period of time (Ulivieri et al., 1994, Wan and Dozier, 1996, Sobrino et al., 2000, Sun and Pinker, 2003, Sobrino et al., 2004, Kerr et al., 2004, Sòria and Sobrino, 2007, Sun and Pinker, 2007, Yu et al., 2009). Indian Earth observation satellites such as INSAT-2E, Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A and INSAT-3D have also TIR channels for surface temperature retrieval purpose. However, little attention has been paid to develop the method for estimating LST from Indian sensors. A Single Channel (SC) algorithm for retrieving LST from the thermal channel (10.5-12.5 µm) of Kalpana-1 (K1) VHRR sensor was developed over India using a radiative transfer model (Pandya et al., 2010, Pandya et al., 2013). In order to exploit the presence of two TIR channels in the INSAT-3D Imager sensor for better estimation of LST, a study has been taken up to develop a method to retrieve LST through a split- window (SW) algorithm. Objective of the present work is to develop an algorithm to retrieve LST using two TIR channels of the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D satellite using a radiative transfer (RT) model over India. Study also presents the comparison of INSAT-3D LST to the contemporaneous LST products available from the MODIS and K1 satellites.
