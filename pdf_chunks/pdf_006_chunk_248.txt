average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is normalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean region (Deb et al., 2008). 13.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control Quality indicator of a derived wind
