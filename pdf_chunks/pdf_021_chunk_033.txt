H-E is available within 15 SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 26 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical weather predictions. Based on above analysis, we can summarize the results as follows: 1. H-E in the present form performs well over most parts of land and oceans but has found to have weakness over high altitude regions. 2. The weakness of the H-E in high altitude areas is successfully addressed in modified H-E. 3. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of 0.78 and rms difference of 46.64 mm with surface observations from IMD weekly Weather Report (WWR). 4. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of 0.78 and rms difference of 45.15 mm with TRMM 3B42 V7. 5. It is found that comparison statistics between modified H-E and WWR is comparable to that between TRMM-3B42 V7 and WWR. However, week-by- week variation in the comparison statistics of H-E versus WWR is more stable than that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. 6. Daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from modified H-E matches well with surface gridded observations over land with correlation of 0.47 and rms difference of 25.40 mm/day. Slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and rms of 22.40 difference mm/day is observed when H-E rain is compared with TRMM 3B42 V7. The results are in tune with comparison between 3B42 V7 with surface observations. 7. The comparison over oceans is not possible with IMD gridded surface observations hence comparison is done with daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain for modified H-E and TRMM 3B42 V7 and that show a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h. 8. The H-E rain shows a good comparison in all the met subdivisions except in â€œNagaland,
