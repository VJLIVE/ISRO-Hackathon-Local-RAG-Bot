clouds give more accurate representation of the actual movement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in these cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud emissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are warmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high in pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at the estimated cloud height. b. Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O): Height assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of view at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud radiances.       c bcd cl P N nER N R nE N R , 1    (2) Opaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:       dp dp p T N db P N t N R P N R s c p p cl c bcd ) ( , , ,    (3) where bcd R is the opaque ("black") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the fractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric pressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with cloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by
