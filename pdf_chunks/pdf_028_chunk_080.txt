The first (second) term in equation (7) is usually known as hydrostatic (or, dry) term (wet term). For realistic suspensions of water and ice, the last two terms of (7) are small in comparison with other terms and are neglected for practical purposes (Hajj et al. 2002). When the signal is passing through the ionosphere the first two terms of (7) can be ignored, as well as higher order ionospheric terms. Therefore, measurement of n directly corresponds to electron density in the ionosphere. In the neutral atmosphere (tangent point height < 60 km), the ionospheric calibration process effectively removes the first order ionosphere term (1/f2) in (7). In order to solve for P, T and/or e, given N, one
