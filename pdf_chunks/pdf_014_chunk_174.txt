INSAT-3D is read. In the first image possible cloud tracers are identified and each selected tracer is represented by a box of 32 x 32 pixel. The tracer box in the first image (i.e. INSAT-3DR) is calibrated with respect to the collocated box in second image (i.e. INSAT-3D) using the following formula:   2 1 2 1 1 1 ) var( ) var( I I I I I I    . Here, I1 and I2 represent the 32 x 32 (in pixel) tracer boxes from first and second image respectively. Var(I1) and Var(I2) represent the variance of the tracer boxes. This is performed to reduce the uncertainty in inter-calibration of two different satellites, all-though their sensor specifications are exactly same. Then cloud tracers are selected by local image anomaly technique in a particular image and subsequently height of the selected tracers is calculated. The height assignment component of operational AMV retrieval algorithm uses widely used traditional INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 154 methods viz. the infrared window (WIN) technique, the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall et. al., 1993). Then selected tracers are tracked in larger window in the subsequent image by using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency [Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970] coefficient. The detailed description of each step is already discussed in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) of infrared and water vapor winds from INSAT- 3D or INSAT-3DR (Deb et al. 2008) Figure 2: A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval of AMVs in staggering mode for a particular time 0500 UTC. If the selected first image is from INSAT-3D, the tracers are selected and height assignment is done, then before tracking the selected tracers in the second INSAT-3DR image, collocated tracer box in INSAT-3DR is calibrated
