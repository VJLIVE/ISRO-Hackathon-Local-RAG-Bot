Fc = 1 for clear Fc = 0.75 for partly cloudy Fc = 0.25 for mostly cloudy Fc = 0 for overcast It is easy to check: M (Iscn, Colat) = Mmod (Iscn, Colat) for overcast M (Iscn, Colat) = Mgeo(Colat, Lon) for clear sky Step-3 Compute the theoretical LW radiance LLW LLW = [ R (Iscn, ’, Colat) .

Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 60 5.2.1.4 Scene Identification for day time The algorithm is similar to night time algorithm, except it deals with the LW - SW pair instead to LW alone. Step-1 Search the geographic information Ngeo From latitude and longitude, the following variables are searched: Ngeo : geotype (ocean, land, desert, snow-ice, coast) Mgeo : the outgoing clear sky flux (Wm-2) ageo : the clear sky albedo The Mgeo and ageo dataset are defined on monthly basis. The Mgeo corresponding to land and desert are corrected for diurnal variations. Step-2 Compute the theoretical albedo â from ageo and ADM For each cloud category ( 1 to 4): â (Iscn, ’) = amod (Iscn, ’) + Fc [ageo(Colat, Lon). ( ’ ) - amod (Ngeo, ’)] ---(6) where Fc is related
