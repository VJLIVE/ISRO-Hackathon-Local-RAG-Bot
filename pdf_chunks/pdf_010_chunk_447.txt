It is different from potential temperature in the sense that it is dependent on the moisture content (moisture content provides additional energy in the form of latent heat release). Its values will be high at lower levels due to presence of water vapor and decreases as one reaches middle troposphere. If lower troposphere is very humid and middle troposphere is very dry then there will be a large vertical difference in equivalent potential temperatures which is indicative of microburst potential if convection were to happen (Pryor et al., 2002). 5.4.2 Operational Implementation From the retrieved temperature and humidity data calculate theta-e at standard pressure levels using the equation given in the previous section. Calculate the difference between the lowest level theta-e and subsequent levels up to 500 hPa. The maximum of these differences is maximum vertical thetae difference (thetaed). 5.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution THETAED ºC - - 2-3oC 0.5 x 0.5 deg 5.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Lat, lon, thetaed Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E. 5.6 Validation 5.6.1 Data Required Collocated radiosonde measurements of temperature and humidity profiles. 5.6.2 Methods of Validation Direct comparison between thetaed values calculated from radiosonde measurements and from the sounder. 5.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc.) Accuracy of thetaed calculated from the sounder depend on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles. 5.8 References Pryor, K.L., Ellrod, G.P., and A.A., Bailey, 2002: Convective downburst potential using GOES sounder derived products.
