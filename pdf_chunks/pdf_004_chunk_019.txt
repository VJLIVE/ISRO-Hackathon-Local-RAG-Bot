For χ=0°, calculate wind speed WS1i using equation (6) for the “ ith” backscatter measurement by varying wind speed over full GMF range with interval δWS1 (1.0 m/s). Using all WS1i, also find the weighted mean Wm and the normalized standard deviation NSD values from equations (9) and (11), respectively, 2) Truncating WS1i with 1.0 m/s precision denoted by WStrnci, evaluate wind speed regimes ∆WS1i separately for all the beams using the following equation ∆WS1i = WStrnci ± δWS1.δχ 13 17 3) Repeat steps (1 and 2) using ∆WS1i for the remaining trial directions 4) Find vector solutions by searching minima of NSD along χ yielding NS solutions with Wn m wind speed and χn direction and the corresponding NSDn values 5) Find precision direction solution χn prcn through calculating minimum of quadratic fit of NSDn values obtained for χ varied between χn±δχ with 1° trial direction interval starting with wind speed search regime ∆WS1i at χn-δχ trial direction 6) At precision direction solutions χn prcn, find Wn m and NSDn through step 2 exploiting ∆WS1i values at χn-δχ trial direction. The derived precision solutions of wind speed, direction and corresponding NSD are denoted
