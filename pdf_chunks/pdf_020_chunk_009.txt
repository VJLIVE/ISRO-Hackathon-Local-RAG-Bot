compositing method will be used to estimate the surface reflectance. The INSAT-3D/3DR visible channel radiance is converted to top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. TOA reflectance is then corrected for ozone and water Vapor absorption. Water vapour and ozone concentration are used from NCEP model data. Further Rayleigh reflectance is removed from the gaseous absorption corrected TOA reflectance to get Rayleigh corrected reflectance. This reflectance has aerosol and surface contribution only. Now for each pixel, the 30 day previous Rayleigh corrected reflectance is sorted and first and second minima is computed. First minima represent the clearest condition, however, due to cloud shadow contamination, sometimes first minima may not be the true representative of surface reflectance, therefore to remove shadow effect, and we put a threshold test on first minima. If first minima are less than 0.04 then second minima will be considered otherwise first minima is considered. The threshold of 0.04 on first minimum to avoid shadow effect is empirical. This sorting of Rayleigh corrected reflectance and selection of first or second minima is done for all pixel to obtain clear composite image. By using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes that aerosol would increase the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the time is somewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time is needed for at least one cloud-free observation. Knapp et al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. The clear composite reflectance is then corrected for background aerosol optical depth (0.02 and 0.04 for ocean and land respectively) to estimate Lambertian surface reflectance (œÅsurf). The image in figure (1) shows Lambartian surface reflectance computed using above mentioned method from INSAT-3D data from 4-31 December, 2013 and 4-31 January 2014 which is used for aerosol inversion on 1 January
