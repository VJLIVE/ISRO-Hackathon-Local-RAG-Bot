Study of Monsoon Onset over Kerala during 2024 using satellite observations Region: 50°E:65°E 0°N:10°N Peak of TPW: 16 May 2024 Prediction of Onset: 03 June 2024 (after 18 days from peak of TPW, ±4 days) Pentad Wind at 850 hPa during pre-monsoon month of 2024 The wind reversal over equator yet to occur and the westerly wind got stronger after the peak TPW achieved. Conclusion • A peak of TPW over the Arabian Sea (50°E:65°E; 0°N:10°N) is occurred 18 days prior to Onset at Kerala. • MJO start forming at the same time over equatorial Indian Ocean. • The monsoon wind (wind reversal over equator and strong westerly wind) over Arabian Sea into Indian landmass started after the peak of TPW observed. • The present analysis lead to the conclusion that the Onset may occurred on 03 June 2024 with a error of ±4 days. • We may like to update our prediction if any cyclonic condition occur over Bay of Bengal.
