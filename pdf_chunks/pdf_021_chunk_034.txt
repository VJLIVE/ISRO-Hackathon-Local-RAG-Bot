with IMD gridded surface observations hence comparison is done with daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain for modified H-E and TRMM 3B42 V7 and that show a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h. 8. The H-E rain shows a good comparison in all the met subdivisions except in “Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura (NMMT)” and “Coastal Andhara Pradesh”, which are also poorly comparable with TRMM 3B42 V7. The reason needs to be further investigated. 9. Over all, rain from modified H-E is comparable to TRMM 3B42 V7 with an advantage of near real time availability of measurements (within 30 minutes) compared to 4 months for the availability of TRMM 3B42 V7 product. The modified H-E is soon going to be made operational both at SAC and MOSDAC sites. A “Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document” is presently under preparation. 8.0 Implementation Steps The modified H-E is already implemented offline and running flawlessly. The present operational structure of H-E module comprising of two main programs called HEM and HEG. The HEM takes Earth elevation model (ETOPO2) as static data input and NCEP GFS model file as dynamic input and provides the correction files for equilibrium level, SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 27 orography, TPW and RH. The HEM uses three separate programs as subroutines for orographic correction, wind interpolation and a atmospheric thermodynamic model for the calculation of LNB/EL. The HEG takes INSAT-3D level1 files as input along with correction files to produce the rain at every pixel within the study area. This is illustrated in flow chart 1 (Fig. 17). In the modified scheme, new HEM removes the program for atmospheric thermo dynamics and includes the necessary model equations in the main body of HEM itself. The modified HEM also takes histogram equalization matched up files for each of the height bins of the parameter
