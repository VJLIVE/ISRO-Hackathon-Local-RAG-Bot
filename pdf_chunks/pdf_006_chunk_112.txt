on the above criterion. Thresholding technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness temperature in thermal band is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in decreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 92 based on the assumption that SST is homogeneous and warmer than clouds; thus clouds can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value or larger standard deviation. Further, the cloud flags generated by cloud mask routine will be used to detect the clouds. SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. 5.4.1.1.5 Error analysis The uncertainty in the INSAT-3D SST retrieval is straightforward to calculate. Taking equation (1) and performing an error analysis, one sees that the error in SST can be represented as: where et is the total error, ai are the estimation coefficients, and ei is the error apparent for each band i used in the algorithm. ei is given by with eia being the error due to atmospheric correction and NEÔÅÑTi deriving from instrumental design and performance considerations. Since the constants ai are order 1, and one assumes that the nadir and/or atmospheric errors are comparable and the various bands have similar characteristics, one can see the error scales as where n is the number of bands used. This analysis makes clear the fact that calibration and/or atmosphere correction errors are important components of the error budget, i.e., 0.1K of error in calibration for a band is effectively an rms error in a dual band algorithm of 0.14K, assuming perfect atmospheric correction. Therefore, we have requested that the calibration be demonstrably accurate at the choice of 0.05K level to minimize the effect of calibration errors. The best atmospheric correction currently available for ATSR suggests that errors
