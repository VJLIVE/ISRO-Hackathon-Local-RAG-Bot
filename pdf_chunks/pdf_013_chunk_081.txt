computed from moving last 20-day composite. Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during daytime Rlincld_day = f (Ta, RH, CI) (8) Where Ta = Air temperature, RH = Relative humidity, CI = Clearness Index Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during night time Rlincld_night = f (Ta, RH) (9) Where, Ta = Air temperature, RH = Relative humidity Outgoing longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlocld) during day and night time Rlocld = f (OLR, LULC) (10) INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 70 Where, OLR= Out Going Long Wave Radiation, LULC = Land Use Land Cover ( From AWiFS, provided by NRSC) To estimate Rnclr in cloudy sky first the cloudy pixel will be identified by using INSAT generated cloud mask for each dataset. Then these empirical model will be applied at spatial scale from cloudy-sky acquisition for cloudy pixels. The overall flow of algorithm is shown in Figure 1. For each hourly acquisition, clear sky and cloudy sky models simultaneously applied and will generate Rn over Indian land mass. To generate daily average net radiation (Rndly) at least one acquisition is required in each two hours to compute Rndly. If there is two consecutive hourly data gap exists within 24-hoursâ€™ timeframe, then daily net radiation will not be computed. For each hourly acquisition, clear sky and cloudy sky models simultaneously applied and will generate Rn over Indian land mass. 5.4.3. Sensitivity Analysis The 1-dimensional sensitivity analysis of whole algorithm will be done for net shortwave and net longwave in clear sky and cloudy sky. For net shortwave in clear and cloudy sky albedo and for net longwave clear sky LST sensitivity will be evaluated. For cloudy sky, weather forecast based air temperature and humidity along with INSAT derived OLR sensitivity will be done in future. The high
