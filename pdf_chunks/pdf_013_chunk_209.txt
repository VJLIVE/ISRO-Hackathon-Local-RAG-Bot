Step 2: Cloud Classification (Deep Convective (DC), DC with/without thin Cirrus (DCC), Mid to upper level clods with/without thin Cirrus using an IR and WV channels. This threshold INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 181 based cloud classification is provided in detail by Inoue (1987) and Roca and Ramanathan (2000). Step 3: Grid Average of IR TBs (0.10x0.10) to match with microwave rainfall from TRMM (i.e. collocation of KALPANA-IR-TBs and TRMM rainfall applied to the INSAT-3D-IR-TBs based on histogram matching technique). Step 4: Calibration of IR brightness temperatures with the contemporary microwave radiometric measurements of rainfall (e.g. TRMM Rainfall from NASAâ€™s GPROF algorithm). Step 5: The global bias correction based on a polynomial model of the suitable form designed on the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). Step 6: the orographic correction is based on the climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions (Mahesh et al., 2014). Step
