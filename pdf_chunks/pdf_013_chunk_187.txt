latter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the 3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity of a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR window: there is a large contribution of reflected radiation at the cloud top. Clouds with small hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm radiance. An increase in cloud particle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the cloud top reduces the 3.9 mm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar radiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 mm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals are generally larger than cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud particles effective radius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth. Several methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from various cloud types. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and Nakajima and King (1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form between 22,000 and 35,000 feet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates areas of moisture. Black depicts neutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a multispectral rainfall estimation technique based on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 km2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) showed to be the critical limit beyond which a further increase in cloud cluster area does not result in higher rain rates. IR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for application to rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective rainfall areas using split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 1987a,b, 1997) and are instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 1985).
