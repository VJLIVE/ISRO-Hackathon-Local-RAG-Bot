tests 6. Cloud edge detection algorithm A difference image is produced from 10.7 and 3.9-Î¼m channels and an adjacent pixel test is performed to detect cloud edges. 9.5 Output Generation of smoke map 9.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Output: lat , lon, Smoke flag Smoke flag: 1 - Smoke pixels, 0 - Non-smoke pixels Domain : 40 S to 40 N, 30 E to 120 E 9.6 Validation This gives an outline of proposed validation methodology. 9.6.1 Data Required Data from different sensors required for validation Acquisition Time Sensor Area Forest fire event MODIS, AVHRR Indian region 9.6.2 Method of Validation 1. Validation through comparison with images acquired over forest fire events from other sensors. 2. Validation through temporal monitoring. 3. Validation by matching with neighbourhood fire pixels, which is generated through fire identification algorithm (FI) 9.7 Technical Issues Accuracy of the product will depend on the accuracy of the input radiance. Further some limitations in the present study are listed as: 1. False classification due to noisy pixels. 2. Only daytime detection is possible. 3. Algorithm will be sensitive to the dataset used for defining the thresholds. 4. Cloud and smoke mixed pixels can give rise to misclassification. 9.8 Future work 1. Further tuning of thresholds by inclusion of more training datasets. Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 149 2.
