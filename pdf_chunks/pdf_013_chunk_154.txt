of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: (a) Infrared Window Channel (WIN): In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. (b) Cloud Base Method (BASE): Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. Assuming the
