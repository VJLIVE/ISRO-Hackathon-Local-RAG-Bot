The parameter soil thermal inertia, Γ, is a key variable for estimating G0 using Eq. (10). Murray and Verhoef adopted the concept of normalized thermal conductivity (O. Johansen 1977) and developed a physical method to calculate Γ as τ = exp [ϒ (1- Srϒ-δ)] (τ* - τ0) + τ0 (8) where Γ and Γ0 are the thermal inertia for saturated and air-dry soil (J m−2 K−1 s−0.5) respectively. Also τ0 = -1062.4 Ө* + 1010.8 & τ* = 788.2 (Ө*-1.29). θ (cm3 cm−3) as soil porosity (equal to the saturated soil moisture content); γ (−) is a parameter depending on soil texture obtained from soil map ; Sr is the mositue availability at surface obtained moisture availability subroutine from STIC model. For instantaneous observations using satellite data n =1 and phase ɸ can be taken as 00.

With the two boundary values (i.e., Δt =1.5 h for fc=1 and Δt=0h for fc=0), a linear approach is proposed here to describe time
