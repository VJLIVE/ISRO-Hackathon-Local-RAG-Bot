Equation 5 is the general equation of transfer and it is fundamental in the discussion of any radiative transfer process. The RTE for Plane-Parallel Atmosphere In plane-parallel atmospheres the medium is stratified in planes perpendicular to a given direction z, such that the optical properties of the medium are functions of z and  only. Since thickness of a planetary atmosphere is generally small compared with its radius, thus this assumption is universally applied. From figure we have dz ) ( d μ dz ) ( d θ cos ds ) ( d   Thus equation 3 in terms of z, μ , and φ : ) φ , μ ,z( J ) φ , μ ,z ( I dz ) φ , μ ,z ( dI )z ( β μ ν ν ν ν   (4) here in J, 'φ d'μ d 'φ d'θ d'θ sin ' Ω d    (5) so that       1 1 ν 0 π 2 0 ν ν ν ν 'φ d'μ d
