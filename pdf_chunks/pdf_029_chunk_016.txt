oxygen for the tropical atmosphere. From figure 3, it is clear that that band 2, 3, 5 and 6 are completely free from the water vapour or oxygen absorption. Band 8 is also almost free from water vapour but with very little contamination, however. Table 5 shows the water vapour transmittance obtained after convolving the transmittance curve with band-8 spectral response function, where form it is verified that the contamination is not more than 1% even at high water vapour content of around 6 cm. There may be an error of about 1-2% if water vapour content is very high >6 cm but such conditions are rare and often gets masked as clouds. Table 4.

In normal conditions, heavy/thick clouds can be distinguished and masked just by applying an appropriate threshold on visible channel measurements, however, thin clouds especially at cloud edges frequently create problems. An astringent threshold can be used to mask such pixels but it also masks heavy aerosol plumes. For this reason in the present algorithm, a visible channel threshold is used to mask
