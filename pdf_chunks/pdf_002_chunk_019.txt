2012 and found a correlation of 0.86 between SAPHIR and 2A12, and 0.68 between SAPHIR and 2A25 observations. For the same month, we find a correlation of 0.71 between 2A12 and 2A25. While comparing the statistics, it has to be borne in mind that TMI and PR have near concurrent observations (within 1 min), whereas SAPHIR may have large time differences with TMI and PR observations. Nevertheless, the SAPHIR performs very well vis-Ã -vis TMI and PR. We have further presented rain from SAPHIR associated with a tropical cyclone Phailin that persisted over the Bay of Bengal from 9-12 October, 2013. This was recorded as a category 5 cyclone with a maximum wind speed of about 140 knots. Phailin made its landfall on 12 October 2013. A cyclonic system is an excellent atmospheric phenomena to critically evaluate the performance of the retrieval algorithm as several types of clouds and rain structures are present in the system. For comparison purpose, we have analysed all the available rain products over that region which are coincident with the SAPHIR. We use 3B42 available as 3-hourly averaged rain rate, 3B40-RT and GSMaP available as hourly averaged rain rates for this comparison. 3B42 (Huffman et al., 2007) is a merged product, 3B40-RT is an intermediate product of 3B42 which is derived from microwave observations only, whereas GSMaP (Aonashi et al., 2009) is a 0.10X0.10 grided rain product which is available hourly. All the comparison performed here, are in 0.250X0.250 rectangular grid. We calculate the rain from SAPHIR and presented in Fig 10 (a). The corresponding rain from 3B42, GSMaP and 3B42-RT are shown in Fig 10 (b), (c) and (d), respectively. Over the study area, the Megha-Tropiques has an observation time of ~2050 UTC, whereas all the other products are at 2100 UTC. From these figures
