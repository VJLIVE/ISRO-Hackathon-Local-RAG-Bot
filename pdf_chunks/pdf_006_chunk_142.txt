2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has been successfully used to separate some types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006). 7.2.1.2 Estimation of Snow Reflectance in Himalaya In order to estimate snow fraction important step is estimation of reflectance. Reflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose. One of the parameter, which can influence satellite obtained reflectance is terrain topography. The relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will determine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. The analysis carried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the amount of incident solar radiation for an increase of 10 in terrain slope (Srinivasulu and Kulkarni, 2003). Various parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral irradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth- sun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum and minimum radiances in the sensor bands.
