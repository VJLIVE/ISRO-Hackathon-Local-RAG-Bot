Introduction The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving High Resolution Visible Winds (HRVIS) from INSAT-3DR imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3DR will have one visible channel (0.55 – 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3DR visible channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 13.2.1. Overview and background Spatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of geostationary satellite images. Given
