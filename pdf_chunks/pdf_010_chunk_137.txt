Kulkarni And S.K. Singh SD Baseline Document EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Algorithms needs be developed to estimate snow depth using INSAT 3D Met payload. Important step in estimation of snow depth is generation of snow fraction map. Since Himalayan region is highly mountainous, the data processing would initially need calibration, georeferencing, atmospheric correction, snow pixel detection, cloud masking, local illumination angle correction, diffuse radiation correction, BDRF correction and orthorectification. This will be followed by Linear or non-linear mixing modeling to estimate snow fraction in each pixel. The
