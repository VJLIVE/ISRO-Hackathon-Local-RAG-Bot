fields Geoid (geoid) - actually geoid undulation, but called simply geoid - and Mean Sea Surface (mean_sea_surface) are distances above the reference ellipsoid, as is the Sea Surface Height. These values are for the location indicated by latitude and longitude. If the values of these fields are needed at a different location within the current frame, along-track interpolation may be done using the high rate (40/second) range and altitude values. As the geoid is derived from the mean sea surface, the latter is the better-known quantity. The residual surface with respect to the geoid is sometimes called the "dynamic topography" of the ocean surface. See also discussions of mean sea surface and geoid in sections 5.3 and 5.4.

Mean Sea Surface and Adjustment of the Cross Track Gradient In order to study sea level changes between two dates, it is necessary to difference sea surface heights from different cycles at the exact same latitude-longitude, so that the not well-known time-invariant geoid cancels out. However, the (O)(I)GDR samples are not given at the same latitude-longitude on different cycles. They are given approximately every 1 sec along the pass (about 6 km, the time difference and distance vary slightly with satellite height above the surface), and the satellite ground track is allowed to drift by +1 km. This introduces a problem: on different cycles the satellite will sample a different geoid profile. This effect is the so-called cross-track geoid gradient, and Brenner and Koblinsky [1990] estimated it at about 2 cm/km over most of the ocean, larger over continental slopes, reaching 20 cm/km at trenches. Even if the passes repeated exactly, one would have to interpolate along the pass (say, to a fixed set of latitudes) because a 3
