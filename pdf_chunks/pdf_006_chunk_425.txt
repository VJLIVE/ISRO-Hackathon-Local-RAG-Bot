One year data from at least 10 locations of AMS over different climatic conditions will be used. The selection criteria for choosing quality validation datasets are described below : a) Days with daily insolation estimates constituted from at least one instantaneous insolation per hour between 00 GMT to 1300 GMT will only be used for validation. These maintain diurnal symmetry to produce reliable daily integral b) The days with in situ continuous half-an-hourly measurements are retained for validation. The days with any data loss due to communication failure will be rejected. c) Diurnality and seasonality checkings will be carried out d) Error statistics in the form of bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient will be generated. 20.7.2.2 Comparison with other sources of spatial data Comparison with other sources of insolation product over India or overlapping region such as insolation from MSG over Africa or insolation from GMS partly over Indian sub- continent,
