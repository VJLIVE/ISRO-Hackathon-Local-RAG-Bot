to be used in real-time for height assignment To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR N (∆U2) = ∑ (Ui –Ur)2 i=1 N (∆V2) = ∑ (Vi –Vr)2 i=1 (MCD) = [ (∆U2) + (∆V2) ]1/2 ≠ (MVD) Visible wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 211 and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. 4. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of cloud-tracers. The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC. 13.8 References 1.
