Keeping this fact in mind the latest series of GOES-12/13/14 had a CO2 channel instead of the split window thermal IR channel. This method is used for deriving cloud top pressure and temperatures from VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) (Menzel and Strabala 1989; Menzel et. al 1992) observations, High resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) (Wylie and Menzel 1999) observations, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Plantick et al. 2003; Menzel et al. 2008) radiances and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sounder (Menzel et al. 1992; Menzel and Purdom 1994) observations. Several sensitivity studies such as Menzel et al. (1992) and Baum and Wielicki (1994) have already been carried out to quantify errors arising from different sources. The CO2 slicing technique can be understood by calculating the radiances using radiative transfer models in an atmosphere with a single cloud layer. For a given cloud element in a field of view (FOV), i.e. a single sounder pixel, the radiance observed, R(), in spectral band , can be written as: U(Q) = NUTV_ + (1 −N)UTVW ------------------- (1) Where U(Q) is observed radiance in band , N is the fractional cloud coverage, UTVW is radiance from clear portion and UTV_ is radiance from the cloud covered portion.
