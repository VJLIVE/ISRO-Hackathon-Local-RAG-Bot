Radiosonde profiles collocated with satellite observations will be generated over clear-sky conditions for different regions representing entire variability in atmospheric profiles. These collocated observations will also be used to correct the biases in the forward model, and then incorporated in the regression and physical retrieval routines for accurate retrievals and convergence. Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 263 16.6.1 Radiance bias removal Atmospheric profile retrieval is based on modifying the surface temperature and atmospheric temperature/moisture profiles in a manner such that brightness temperatures calculated agree with those observed from the satellite, within some uncertainty estimate, for the sounding spectral bands. For INSAT-3D Sounder we begin with a first guess profile, which is a weighted linear combination of profiles obtained from regression retrieval and NWP model forecast, interpolated in time and space to the location of the satellite measurement. The difference between the observation and the "forward calculation" from the first-guess profile represents the information available in the observation. However, in practice there are generally bias errors associated with the comparison of observation and the forward calculation. These may be due to calibration error, uncertainties in the filter functions, or imprecision in the transmittance model used in the forward calculation. Consequently, prior to calculating retrieval, bias error for each band is
