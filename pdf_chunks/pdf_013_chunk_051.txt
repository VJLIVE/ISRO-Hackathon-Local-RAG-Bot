global water, energy and carbon cycles, and provides a link between the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface (Betts et al., 1996; Jiménez et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015). It is also an important indicator of hydrologic and heat variations under a changing climate and anthropogenic interference (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998; Ohmura and Wild, 2002; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Accurate quantification of ET is thus critical for understanding the hydro-climatologic processes and the interactions of the Earth system (Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002). However, the estimation of large-scale ET from ground-based measurements alone remains challenging due to the sparse network of point observations and the high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of ET (Xu and Singh, 2005; Xue et al., 2013). To address this limitation, a number of global ET products have been derived in recent years, including remote sensing-based products (Su, 2002; Muet al., 2007, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009, 2010; Miralles et al., 2011b; Yang et al., 2013). There are many methods mentioned in the literature such as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen 2013), TSEB (Norman & Becker, 1995) and SEBS (Su, 2002). Most of the model uses the operationally available polar/ near-polar orbit satellite datasets such as MODIS, ASTER, LANDSAT have long been utilized for the estimation of ET from field to regional scale. However, the output records suffer from spatial and temporal gaps due to cloud cover and in-frequent image availability based on satellite overpass schedule. However, geostationary satellites, have high temporal resolution continuously measuring several factors related to land surface and the atmosphere over large regional scales. Thus, they have high potential in calculating land surface and water cycle at hourly temporal resolution. This shows the vital role of geostationary satellite in modelling Evapotranspiration on spatial scale. Operational ET INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November
