ATBD Document, May 2015 250 atmospheric density decreases exponentially with height. These two contrasting effects combine in such a way that, at some intermediate height, the contribution of a parcel to the radiation reaching space is a maximum. The variation of the radiance to space as a function of height is shown by the curve on the right of the Fig.1. Most of the radiation to space originates in a layer around the peak of weighting function. From the knowledge of atmospheric composition and spectroscopic parameters we can calculate where in the atmosphere this layer will be. Then the intensity of the radiation can be interpreted in terms of the mean temperature of the layer. Using radiation at different frequencies for which the absorption strength is different, we can build a group of weighting functions, which provide information on the mean temperatures of many such layers, thus leading to the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profile from a set of multi-frequency measurements. It is important to note that the weighting functions are broad, implying that the satellite instrument can sense the mean properties of broad layers very well, but it is only able to sense the characteristics of single levels or narrow layers insofar as they are correlated with the properties of the broad layers. Broad nature of the weighting functions restricts the capability of satellite sounders to detect small-scale vertical structure of the atmospheric. Infrared sounder channels have spectral widths typically hundreds of times greater than the atmospheric absorption lines. Therefore they average frequencies for which the absorption strengths are very different. This has the effect of broadening the weighting functions considerably. By using instruments of much higher spectral resolution, such as interferometers or grating spectrometers (e.g. AIRS, IASI), it is possible to achieve spectral resolutions closer to the
