lines. Therefore they average frequencies for which the absorption strengths are very different. This has the effect of broadening the weighting functions considerably. By using instruments of much higher spectral resolution, such as interferometers or grating spectrometers (e.g. AIRS, IASI), it is possible to achieve spectral resolutions closer to the widths of the atmospheric absorption lines. In this way instruments with several thousand channels and much sharper weighting functions can be built. In order for atmospheric temperature to be inferred from measurements of thermal emission, the source of emission must be a relatively abundant gas of known and uniform distribution. Otherwise, the uncertainty in the abundance of the gas will make ambiguous the determination of temperature from the measurements.

The forward problem: The instrument makes measurements of radiance in a number of channels λi. For each channel, we can write a radiative transfer equation (excluding reflection term): This equation expresses the forward problem for the channel, i.e. given the state of the atmosphere; the solution of this equation gives us the radiance incident at the satellite in this channel. Using the radiances measured
