H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H- E is also attempted and is shown in the Table 4. It may be recalled that 3B42 V7 is from state-of-art algorithm that combines IR and Microwave Measurements and adjust the biases with surface observations. Despite of these facts, H-E results are comparable (or even better) to that of 3B42 V7 measurements. In order to see that how modified H-E measurements compare with only Microwave measurements of precipitation, we compared 2 weeks (3 – 16 July 2014) of weekly met-subdivisions averaged H-E rain with TRMM 3B41RT. The comparison results are shown in Table 5 below. The comparison shows poorer correlation between 3B41 and WWR that that between H-E and WWR. Thus, modified H-E rain is having a better representation of the surface observations than that by only microwave based rain rates from TRMM 3B41RT.

Before using them for further comparisons in finer spatial and temporal scales, we examined their integrity vis-à-vis rain values provided in WWR. We averaged gridded rain values and generated weekly rain maps similar to those provided in WWR. The comparison statistics of IMD gridded dataset with WWR is provided in Table 6 below: Table 6: Comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from
