than it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to ET0 calculation. Figure 4.

Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements The daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available through MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other routine inputs from WRF forecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 estimates at regional scale following the steps mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based regional ETo estimates, the measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were used (Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables at 30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six sites over different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for different time period as listed in Table 6. The ETo was calculated on daily basis using AMS half-an-hour average measurements. Table 6.
