2018 143 Step 2: Height assignment  Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.  Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above. Step 3: Tracking  The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous three images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2 and 2-3) and stored in a file. The selection of three images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Calculate wind speed and direction. 13.6.
