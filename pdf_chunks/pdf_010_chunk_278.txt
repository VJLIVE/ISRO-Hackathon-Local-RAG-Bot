the same as the mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.

It is suggested to report mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. 14.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds is possible from geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. MIR wind is comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi- spectral observations. 1.
