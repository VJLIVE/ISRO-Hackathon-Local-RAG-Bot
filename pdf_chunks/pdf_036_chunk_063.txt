by R. Ray. This model is identical to 4.7 in all constituents save S2. GOT4.7 used the following data: • 364 cycles of T/P • 114 cycles of T/P on the interlaced orbit • 117 cycles of ERS1 and ERS2 • 126 cycles of GFO None Jason data has been used in this solution. The solution consists of independent near-global estimates of 10 constituents (K1, K2, M2, M4, N2, O1, P1, Q1, S1, S2) . An a priori model was used that consisted of the hydrodynamic model FES 2004 [Lyard et al. 2006], and several other local hydrodynamic models, GOT4.8 implement the fixed-up dry troposphere correction for TP where the air tide wasn't being handled correctly (whereas it is in Jason GDRs), and this affects S2 mostly. Another difference between GOT4.7 and GOT4.8 is that 4.7 had not applied the TP Cg correction, while 4.8 did use the Cg. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 45 3.2.6.2. FES2004 Ocean Tide Model The FES2004 model is a finite-element hydrodynamic model, constrained with tide gage and past altimeter data [Le Provost, 2001] (see ocean_tide_sol2). It is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open boundary conditions and no data assimilation). FES2004 is the last update of the FES solution. Tide gages and reprocessed TP and ERS crossover data are assimilated in the FES2002 hydrodynamical solution. The altimeter data reprocessing consists in a new atmospherical forcing response correction (Mog2D-G) applied to the data before the harmonic analysis. FES2004 includes the M2, S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, P1, Q1 tides. Four hydrodynamical long period tides and the non-linear M4 tide are also included in the
