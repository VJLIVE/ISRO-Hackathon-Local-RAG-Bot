ordinate method with sufficient streams. In this DOM model it is assumed that cross-polarization scattering in the scattering source term is negligible and the scattering phase function is assumed to follow Henyey- Greenstein equation, and is expended with Legendre polynomial (pl) as Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 15            N 0 0 N 0 0 2 3 0 2 2 0 ) θ (cos p A ) θ (cos p g )1 2 ( ) θ cos g 2 g 1( g 1 ) θ (cos P        (14) For azimuth-independent case (spheres, randomly-orientated irregular particles), the cosine of the scattering angle 0 θ cos can be denoted as ’ (Liou, 1974), so that         N 0 N 0 0 )'μ ( p ) μ ( p A )'μ ( p ) μ ( p g )1 2 ( )'μ , μ ( P ) θ (cos P          (15) Where asymmetry factor g is calculated following Mie theory (Bohren and Huffman, 1983), ) μ ( p is the lth order Legendre polynomial and N is the number of terms to add. In DOM, N=2n-1 (2n is the stream number). To minimize the error associated with this cutoff, a -adjustment (scaling g, , and 0) is applied following (Fu and Liou, 1992). In performing numerical calculations, we divide the atmosphere into many layers and assume that all microphysical properties (e.g., particle concentration, liquid/ice water content, etc.) are uniform within each layer, but temperature varies linearly with optical depth. By solving the Ljs the radiances at quadrature angles (i) are obtained. A boundary condition at the surface allows us to calculate
