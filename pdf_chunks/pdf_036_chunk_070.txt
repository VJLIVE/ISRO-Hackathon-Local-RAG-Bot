effect on the sea surface height is the sum of three values from the (O)(I)GDR: Tide Effect = Geocentric Ocean Tide + Solid Earth Tide + Pole Tide (See also section 5.9 and subsections) Geocentric Ocean Tide : The geocentric ocean tide provided on the (O)(I)GDR is actually the sum total of the ocean tide with respect to the ocean bottom, and the loading tide height of the ocean bottom. Geocentric Ocean Tide = Ocean Tide + Load Tide The (O)(I)GDR provides a choice of two geocentric ocean tide values, ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2. Each uses a different model for the sum total of the ocean tide and loading tide heights from the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, but both include an equilibrium representation of the long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero frequency (permanent tide) term. Note that the (O)(I)GDR also explicitly provides the loading tide height from each of the two models that are used to determine the two geocentric ocean tide values, load_tide_sol1, load_tide_sol2. Obviously, the geocentric ocean tide values and loading tide values should not be used simultaneously, since the loading tide height would be modeled twice. Solid Earth Tide : Use solid_earth_tide NOTE: Zero frequency (permanent tide) term also not included in this parameter. Pole Tide : Use pole_tide The tide values all have the same sign/sense in that positive numbers indicate that the surface is farther from the center of the Earth. 4.2.2.2. Geophysical Surface - Mean Sea Surface or Geoid The geophysical fields Geoid (geoid) - actually geoid undulation, but called simply geoid - and Mean Sea Surface (mean_sea_surface) are distances above the reference ellipsoid, as is the Sea Surface Height. These values are for the location indicated by latitude and longitude. If the values of these fields are needed at a
