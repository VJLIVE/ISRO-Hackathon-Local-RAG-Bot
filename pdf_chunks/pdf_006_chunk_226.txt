search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 189 template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). It is defined as             n i t t n i s t I I I I E 1 2 1 2 1 (4) Where tI and sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is normalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies
