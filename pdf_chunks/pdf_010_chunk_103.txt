they evaluated six high resolution precipitation products including TRMM- 3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that among 5 satellite based rain products, the 3B42 V7 and is the best performing with respect to surface observations, which on daily scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much more diverse surface and climatic conditions with different cloud types and wide range of precipitation rates during S-W months, we achieve much higher correlation between modified H-E rain with surface observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E vis-Ã -vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D H-E is available within 15 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical weather predictions. 4.7 Future Scope The scheme has to be regularly calibrated with more varied calibration data. Further merging of H-E with microwave observations is desired for more accrate rain measurement. 4.9 References 1. Barrett, E. c., and D. W.
