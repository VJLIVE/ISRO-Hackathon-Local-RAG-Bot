The inheritance of this satellite has come from GOES series of NOAA. Meteorological payloads onboard would be a 6 channel imager and a 19 channel sounder mainly for cyclone and monsoon monitoring, cloud motion vectors winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation monitoring, snow cover detection, mesoscale studies etc. 19 channel Sounder, split thermal window channels, a mid IR thermal window channel and shortwave IR channel are the additions to earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana satellites. Details of Imager channels are given in Table-1. Sea surface temperature would be derived from split thermal window channels (10.2- 11.3m, 11.5 –12.5m)
