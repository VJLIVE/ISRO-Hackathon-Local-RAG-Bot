May 2015 61 Domain : For both GPI and IMSRA the domain for rainfall estimation mainly would be 500 S to 500 N, 300 E to 1300 E. 4.6 Validation Rainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods mentioned above. These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, climate, hydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an idea of their accuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the satellite precipitation estimates against "ground truth" from rain gauge and radar observations. A thorough verification of satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their accuracy in a wide range of weather and climate regimes, give users information on the expected errors in the estimates, help algorithm developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good estimates of absolute accuracy satellite products are verified against very high quality radar and gauge data. However, these sites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial accuracy it is necessary to use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain gauge networks. While these verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, their errors are usually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on short time scales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial scale are required mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges. 4.6.1 Data Required: The following data for validation will be needed Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Dopple Weather Radar 0.250x0.250 -- -- IMD - At all DWR locations (Every 1 Hourly basis 0.250x0.250 grids Fast Response Rain Gauges (for hourly rainfall) & Other Rain gauge Data Rain/day Ground Truth (over land and oceans)
