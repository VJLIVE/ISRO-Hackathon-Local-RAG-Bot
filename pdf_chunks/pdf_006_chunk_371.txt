3D-LST with two other estimates, K1-LST and MOD-LST for three specific time of a day 29th Nov. 2013. The comparison of daytime and nighttime retrievals shows (figure 14, 17 and 20) that the LST values from 3D fairly match with MODIS as well as K1 sensors. The comparison showed a good correlation having R2 values varying from 0.73 (05:30 GMT), 0.66 (09:00 GMT) and 0.79 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. MODIS and from 0.81 (05:30 GMT), 0.80 (09:00 GMT) and 0.51 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. K1. While, the standard error of estimates (SEE) observed between 3D and MODIS were 1.84 K (05:30 GMT), 2.27K (09:00 GMT) and 1.37 K (21:00 GMT). And the SEE observed between 3D and K1 were 1.24 K (05:30 GMT), 1.37K (09:00 GMT) and 1.10 K (21:00 GMT). It is clear that nighttime retrievals showed an excellent match when the LST ranged between 280 to 300 (figure 21). However, for the daytime satellite-passes when temperatures were generally more than 300 K in this part of the globe, 3D-LST showed a deviation as compared to the MOD- LST (figure 15 and 18). In the case of satellite pass of 05:30 GMT, the 3D-LST demonstrated a moderate deviation with SEE=1.84 K (R2=0.73) as compared to the MOD-LST (figure 15). While 09:00 GMT satellite pass showed a slightly high degree of deviation (SEE=2.27 K, R2=0.66) (figure 18). Overall the 3D-LST values showed a good match with the reference LST values in the range of 270-310 K, demonstrating that the SW algorithm is working fairly well. However, for some of the daytime 3D-LST retrievals (e.g. 05:30 GMT), an unambiguous over estimation was observed as compared to MOD-LST retrievals. This overestimation in 3D-LST is apparent at all the LST values independent of low or high values in the daytime. Reasons
