ARGOS-3 Instrument ARGOS is a Data Collection and Localization System dedicated to environmental applications (more than 18000 active platforms). This is a CNES / EUMETSAT / NOAA cooperation and ISRO will join the ARGOS Program with SARAL. Now in its 3rd generation of instruments embarked on EUMETSAT/Metop and NOAA/POES (NOAA-N’), ARGOS-3 on SARAL will fill the 3rd orbit (@ 18h00) of ARGOS-3 system. Figure 8 : Applications of the ARGOS system ARGOS-3 UHF and L band antennas are located on the Earth face of the satellite.

Orbit The SARAL/AltiKa satellite flies on the same ground-track as ENVISAT with a 501 pass, 35-day exact repeat cycle. Orbital characteristics and the equator crossing longitudes for SARAL/AltiKa are given in Tables 10 and 11. To locate a pass on the Earth, Google Earth can be used. More information are given on the AVISO Website about the pass locator: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/data/tools/pass-locator/index.html. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 19 Figure below is a plot of the ground track on a world map (as there are 501 ground tracks, they are represented as ascending and descending passes). Figure 11 : ENVISAT and SARAL/AltiKa ground track coverage every 35 days (ascending and descending passes) The main characteristics of SARAL Sun-Synchronous Orbit are : → The mean classical orbit elements are given in the table below.
