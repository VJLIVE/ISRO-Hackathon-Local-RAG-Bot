Since Himalayan region is highly mountainous, the data processing would initially need calibration, georeferencing, atmospheric correction, snow pixel detection, cloud masking, local illumination angle correction, diffuse radiation correction, BDRF correction and orthorectification. This will be followed by Linear or non-linear mixing modeling to estimate snow fraction in each pixel. The mixing modeling would need large spectral reflectance library of snow and other land features of Himalayan region, to identify end members of snow and snow free terrain. Next important step in the investigation is to develop a relationship between snow fraction and depth. This would need field snow depth data. In North America this relationship was developed using 1400 field observatories. Relationship was found useful; if snow depth is less than 27 cm. Field data needs to be collected from Indian Meteorological Department. 7.2 Introduction 7.2.1 Overview and background The purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth product from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow pack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). However, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region of North America. The accuracy of snow depth retrievals was found 30% of observed snow depth for snow depth below 30 cm. The satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover is independent of snow depth, if snow depth is more than 30 cm (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 116 during wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter
