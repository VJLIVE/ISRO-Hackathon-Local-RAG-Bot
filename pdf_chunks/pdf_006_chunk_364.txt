error of the different terms (alg, NET, and ) and the total error in LST, e(LST). The errors on LST have been calculated by applying Eq. (5-7) to each of the thousands of simulated data points.

In this study, the alg values ranged between 0.68 to 1.52 K. An increase in the algorithm error was observed as view angle varied from lower to higher values. In terms of different contributions to e(LST), it is clearly seen that the less contribution is due to the  uncertainty, with  values ranging between 0.28 to 0.32 K. The NET ranged between 0.32 and 0.37 K. In terms of total errors on LST, e(LST), values ranged between 0.82 K to 1.59 K, with an average error of 1.14 K. Looking at the analysis and results summarized in table 3, it is clear that the proposed SW algorithm performs best with overall error of 1 K when view angles vary between 0 to 35 degree. Since major of the Indian landmass is covered with the view angle up to 35 degree by the INSAT-3D Imager (figure 2), we expect to obtain overall modeling error less than 1 K. 18.5.3 Application of LST algorithm to INSAT-3D Imager data A total of 40 raw images of INSAT-3D Imager sensor for every half an hour time period of 29th Nov.
