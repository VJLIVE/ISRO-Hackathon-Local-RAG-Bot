al 1997). However, the quality control (QC) of WVWV fields still demanded intensive manual intervention. In 1992, NESDIS began the use of first version of new automated winds (CIMSS) software Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 183 package and producing full disk wind set without manual intervention since 1997 by suitably selecting tracers (filtering undesirable scenes) and assigning heights using several methods. The tracking features in subsequent imagery was automated using advanced pattern matching techniques (Merrill et al. 1991) and an automated quality control algorithm was also implemented. Laurent (1993) reports on Water Vapor (WV) wind extraction from Meteosat image data that is carried out under operational conditions. Subsequent years further development has been made by adding quality indicators (Holmlund 1998) to supply the users with additional information about the products. The U.S Geo-stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-8 etc series) are equipped with one imager and two sounder water vapor channels. As of GOES-12 the spatial resolution of the WV imager has been improved from 8Km to 4 Km at the sub-satellite point, and the radiometer is spectrally wider with a central wavelength of 6.5 micro m instead 6.7 micro m. The sounders look progressively deeper into the troposphere as the spectral band wavelength moves away from the 6.3micro m absorption band center. (Menzel et al 1998). This facts opens the opportunity for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of atmospheric motions (Menzel 2001). Water vapor winds from image data taken by the WV channel aboard the Japanese satellite Geo-stationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS)-5 have been produced since 1995, and clear-sky WV segments have been separated since 1998 (Tokuno 1996, 1998). Tokuno et al. (2002) state that the appropriate height assignment of clear-sky WV motion vectors is still an unresolved task. Geo-stationary satellites of the Fengyun-2 series are operated by the National
