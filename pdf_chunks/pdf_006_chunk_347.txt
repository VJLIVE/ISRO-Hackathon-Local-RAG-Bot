be used to indicate the presence of fog in the previous night as fog is the deepest before sunrise. Validation through ground truth As visibility is one of the important criteria for fog identification the observation from station data (where ever available) can also be used as in-situ observation to validate the fog product. These station data may be available with Airport Meteorological Office (AMO) and India Meteorological Department over different locations. 17.7 Technical issues Accuracy of the product will depend on the accuracy of the input radiance. Extensive research and development work is required especially for day time fog detection with the help of radiative transfer model simulations. One has to get various fog/low stratus optical properties such as droplet radius etc., perform radiative transfer model simulations at various solar zenith angles, types of atmosphere to arrive at detection algorithms. 17.8 Future Scope Apart from techniques using visible and thermal channels for the detection of fog, methods to use hyperspectral and multispectral data is required to be developed and implemented.
