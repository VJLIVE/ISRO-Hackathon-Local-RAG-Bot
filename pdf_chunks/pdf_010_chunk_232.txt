available image and process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. The height assignment of WVWV is a long-standing problem in this regard. In cloud free regions, the radiometric signal from pure water vapor structure is a result of emittance over a finite layer. It is further complicated by radiance contributions from multiple moist layer (Weldon and Holmes 1991). Here the challenge is to assign a height that best represents the motion of the feature. In the first step, the instrument measured radiances is converted into brightness temperature, which requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 192 instrument. It is important to note that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly different parts of the H2O absorption band. Sampling the center of the absorption band (around 6.3µm) yields radiation from upper levels of the troposphere. Sampling away from the center of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of the troposphere. Once the target is selected for tracking, the brightness temperature in the target area is averaged and this value will be matched with a collocated model guess temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be used to assign an initial pressure height. 12.4.2 Operational Implementation 1.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT  In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured radiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite.  It is important that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly different parts of H2O absorption band. Sampling the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from the
