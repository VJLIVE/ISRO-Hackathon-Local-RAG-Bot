refractivity and geophysical parameters to be retrieved viz. temperature (T), pressure (P) and water vapor partial pressure (e). However, a brief overview of the theoretical background of the GPS-RO technique, beginning with the raw measurements to the derivation of refractivity, is given for greater comprehension and continuity. 6.2.1 Theoretical Background The basic observables of this technique are the phase and amplitude of the dual- frequency signals transmitted by a GPS satellite and received by the LEO receiver in an occulting geometry as depicted in Fig.1. The recorded phase, corresponding to a single frequency, is the sum of vacuum phase and an excess phase, due to the intervening atmosphere. Obtaining excess phase delay involves precise measurement of GPS and LEO satellite orbits (position and velocities) and phase delays of GPS signals (at L1 and L2 frequencies) to a very high accuracy. From the time series of excess phase delay (obtained after removing vacuum phase delay from measured phase delay) and position and velocities of GPS and LEO, bending angle profile as a function of impact parameter is computed. Figure 1. A schematic diagram of radio occultation sounding geometry The main steps involved in the retrieval of refractivity and related atmospheric parameters are as follows (Steiner et al., 1999): 1. Calculation of the atmospheric bending angle profile from the observed L1/L2 excess phase path time series (including dual-frequency ionospheric correction). 2. Retrieval of the refractive index profile from the atmospheric bending angle profile and conversion to refractivity profile. 3. Calculation of pressure, and temperature based on the refractivity profile (assuming dry air). The pressure and temperature so calculated are the dry pressure and dry temperature, distinct from real pressure and temperature in the water vapor dominant region (i.e. lower troposphere). 4. Deriving water vapor partial pressure with a simultaneous refinement of dry
