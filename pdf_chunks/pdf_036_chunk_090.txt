6 mm. 5.10.2. Barotropic/Baroclinic Response to Atmospheric Forcing The High Frequency Wind and Pressure Response correction, hf_fluctuations_corr, complements the Inverted Barometer (IB) correction. Like both tides and IB, the ocean response to wind and pressure (after removing the IB part) has energy at periods higher than the 20 day implied by the 35-day repeat cycle of SARAL/AltiKa. This correction can be thought of as a departure from the IB response to pressure, although strictly it is the difference between the response to wind and pressure minus the IB. Ali and Zlotnicki [2000] compute this response with a barotropic model that is forced by NCEP operational wind and pressure. The model output is filtered in time to pass frequencies shorter than 20 days. See also Stammer et al. [1999] and Tierney et al. [2000]. The parameter hf_fluctuations_corr is provided in the (I)GDR products as a correction to the inverse barometer correction inv_bar_corr. 5.11. Sigma 0 The backscatter coefficient, sigma0 Ka values (see parameters sig0), reported on the (O)(I)GDR are corrected for atmospheric attenuation using atmos_corr_sig0. Note that "unbiased" sigma0 values are recorded on the SARAL/AltiKa data products. For some geophysical algorithms, an appropriate bias is applied to the provided sigma. These biases have been determined from comparisons to Jason-1 or Jason-2 sigma0. Disclaimer : the SARAL altimeter use a Ka band which is new for nadir altimeter. It is worth recalling that Ka band is highly sensitive to the rain and cloud attenuation. It was not possible to assess precisely the impact on the sigma naught before launch. User are so advised to use this parameter with care. 5.12. Wind Speed The model functions developed to date for altimeter wind speed have all been purely empirical. The model function establishes a relation between the wind speed, and the sea surface backscatter
