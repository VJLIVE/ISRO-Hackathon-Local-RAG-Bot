10 years temperature data from all IMD-stations (as stated in table below), interpolated to geo-referenced raster format (GeoTIFF) at 4x4 km spatial resolution for entire India. This will be useful in defining the background temperature for different temperature zones.

In order to detect the presence of fire in a non-interactive fashion, a set of detection multiband thresholding criteria different for the day and night fire observations are prescribed. These criteria are based on the apparent temperature of the fire pixel and the difference between the fire pixel and its background temperature. In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of fire. 8.4.1 Overview 8.4.1.1 Theoretical Background  Any object above absolute zero ( 0 K; -273.16o C; -459.69o F) emits EMR.  As temp.
