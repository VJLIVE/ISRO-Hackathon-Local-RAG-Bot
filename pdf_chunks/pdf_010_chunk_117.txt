effort focus in the following areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NET for each band, calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration- validation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, and timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit instrument NET performance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget. 5.7 Future Scope Initially, prelaunch algorithm would be used to derive SST. Over a period of approximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias correction and other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should improve the accuracy of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also plays a crucial role in determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of regression coefficients for SST retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy observations data base require nearly 250 buoys distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 years. 5.8 References 1 Anding D and R Kauth (1970) “Estimation of sea surface temperature from space”, Remote Sensing of Environment, 1, 217-220. 2 Barton I J (1983) Dual channel satellite measurements of sea surface temperature.
