variable emissivities tend to be incorrectly classified as cloudy with this test. The problem is mitigated somewhat in the cloud mask by making use of a double-sided test where brightness temperature differences greater than a "low" threshold but less than a "high" threshold are labeled clear while values outside this range are called cloudy. The thresholds are listed in Table 2. This threshold strategy along with the use of clear-sky restoral tests is effective for detecting low-level clouds over deserts. We are leaving these regions as undetermined if it is failing other tests. Detecting clouds at high latitudes using infrared window is a challenging problem due to the cold surface temperatures. Yamanouchi et al. (1987) describe a nighttime polar (Antarctic) cloud/surface discrimination algorithm based upon brightness temperature differences between the AVHRR 3.7 and 11 μm channels and between the 11 and 12 μm channels. We are not attempting at those regions because data at such large angle of view is not very useful and not used for any parameter retrieval. Table 2: Thresholds used for BT11 – BT3.9 test for low clouds are same as in the MODIS cloud mask algorithm. .Scene Type Threshold High confidence clear Low confidence clear Day ocean -8 .0 K -6.0 K -1 0.0 K Night ocean 0.0 K -1.0 K 1.0 K Day land -12.0 K -10.0 K -14. 0 K Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 22 BT3.7 - BT12 TEST This window brightness temperature difference test is applied during the nighttime over some, but not all, surfaces. This difference is useful for separating thin cirrus and cloud free condition and is relatively insensitive to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere (Hutchison and Hardy 1995). This test is executed over land at night. The three thresholds for MODIS algorithm are
