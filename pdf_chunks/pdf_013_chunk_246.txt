Steps for operational implementation The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of Potential evapo- transpiration product generation:  Daily (24 hours) average meteorological data are to be carried out by averaging 3-hourly forecast from WRF (ASCII format) at 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid for all the four variables  Maximum , minimum air temperatures and relative humidity need to be generated from 3- hourly forecasts in a given day  Conversion of all ASCII oouputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 0.05o X0.05o grid resolution  Conversion of all INSAT 3D generated insolation ouput to raster of dimension approx. 0.05o X 0.05o grid resolution  Repojection of operational daily insolation product present Transverse Mercator to geographic projection  Resampling of gridded insolation to WRF grid resolution followed by subsetting for India with same dimensions as that of WRF.  Integration of reprojected daily insolation and 2-D surface of WRF variables in to FAO P- M model to generate regional spatial output of daily ETo is given in flow diagram (Fig.2).
