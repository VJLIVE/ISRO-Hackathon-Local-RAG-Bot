Method of Validation: Currently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm reflectivity and velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development of cyclones providing quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds within and around the storm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing the variations in their amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in polarization state, DWR quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium within the pulse volume. The amount of received power from the distributed target depends on the number of particles within the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, shape, orientation etc. The DWR’s are located at various sites all over the country. All are working operationally. DWR’s estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation needs. Ground-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO’s AWS etc), at high resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High resolution IMD DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several small size study sites with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for instance in 1°x 1° degrees. The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5°x 0.5° to 2°x 2° degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 184 rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in
