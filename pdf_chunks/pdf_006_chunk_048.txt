high spatial and temporal coverage’s etc.). from a hundred of radars on the ground. The inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance emanating from cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only marginally even with significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal coverage of Geostationary optical measurements is the very strong point along with the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only low earth orbiting satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as on now. With the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single satellite (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisage that a technique like GMSRA can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information can be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the techniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below (mainly in cases of IMSRA). A1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method: 1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E using Arkin’s GPI method. 2. To generate mean
