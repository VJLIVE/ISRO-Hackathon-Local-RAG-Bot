Pal WVWV Baseline Document (Version 2) 12.2 Introduction The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Water Vapor Wind Vector (WVWV) from INSAT-3D water channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT- 3D will have one water vapor channel (6.3 -7.1 (m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived WVWV products, the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 12.2.1 Overview and background In early nineties, forecasters have used extensively the water vapor radiances from geo- stationary satellites qualitatively (Weldon and Holmes 1991). In quantitative studies, the first attempt was made by Hayden and Stewart (Hayden and Stewart 1987) by manually tracking moisture features in automated image sequences. Later studies (Laurent 1993, Velden 1993, Holmlund 1993) on this area have shown much maturity with ability of automated wind extraction methods for producing spatially coherent Water Vapor Wind Vector (WVWV) fields comparable in quality to operational cloud-tracked winds. The successful implementation of University of Wisconsin-Madison Co-operative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) automated wind-extraction algorithm operationally at National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) have shown considerable improvement in this regards (Nieman et. al 1997). However, the quality control (QC) of WVWV fields still demanded intensive manual intervention. In 1992, NESDIS began the use of first version of new automated winds (CIMSS) software Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 183 package and producing full disk wind set without manual intervention since
