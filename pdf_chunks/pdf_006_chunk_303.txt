INSAT-3D Sounder retrieval scheme involves two-step approach. In first step, first-guess temperature and humidity profiles are derived based on regression retrieval combined with model forecast. In the second step, accurate temperature and humidity profiles are retrieved based on physical retrieval procedure that uses non-linear Newtonian iterative method to adjust first guess profiles. Ozone profile and integrated amount is retrieved using regression retrieval and used as first guess for the physical retrieval routine. 16.4.1.1 Theoretical Background Atmospheric sounding is one of the most important applications of satellite measurements in meteorology, which involves retrieving vertical profiles of
