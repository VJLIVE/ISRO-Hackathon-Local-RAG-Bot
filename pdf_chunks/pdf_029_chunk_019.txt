reflectance for each spectral channel. The performance of function developed to estimate band-3 and band-6 surface reflectance using NIR channel is shown in figure 3. From figure 3 it is seen that surface reflectance in band-3 can be estimated using both red as well as NIR bands and NDVI within root mean square error (rmse) of around 0.02. For lower surface reflectance the scatter is less while on bright surfaces the significant scatter is observed. In figure 4, the data point density is higher for low surface reflectance pixels, which in general true as natural targets are dark in blue wavelengths, therefore excluding bright surface the rmse will become significantly lower than 0.02. In a similar way, function to estimate surface reflectivity in band-2 using band-3 is also developed. Figure 4.

(11) Solving this equation, the top of the atmosphere radiance (𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡 ∗ ) can be computed assuming tropical atmosphere in the range of 0.4-1.0 𝜇𝑚 at the spectral resolution of 0.0025𝜇𝑚, which are then convoluted to OCM-2 spectral response functions to simulate observations. The radiative scattering due to aerosols is simulated assuming 2 fine aerosol models defined as moderately and strongly absorbing aerosols, and 1 coarse aerosol model named dust aerosol model.
