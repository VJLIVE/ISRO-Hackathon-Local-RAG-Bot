sky net radiation at each hour will be used to generate hourly net radiation (Rn) over Indian land mass. xiv) The average of 24-hours net radiation will be used for generation of daily net radiation (Rndly). The pre-condition for generation of Rndly is that there will no consecutive two- hour data loss within 24-hours of a day. 5.5. Outputs 5.5.1.

Validation 5.6.1. Data required To validate the INSAT derived instantaneous hourly and daily net radiation in situ measured and globally products from other satellite as well as model will be used. The detailed requirement of satellite and in situ data is given in table 5. For validation one-year data covering all season will be used.
