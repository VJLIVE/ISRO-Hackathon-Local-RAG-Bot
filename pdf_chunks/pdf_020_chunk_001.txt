Aerosols have large- scale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman and Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood and Boucher 2000) and interacting with clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is also critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and military operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to CO2 greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, 1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element. When in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility, and public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol distribution at global and regional scales. This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the updated algorithm used to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOD) for the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager instrument operating from a geostationary platform. In comparison to previous algorithm (see INSAT-3D AOD ATBD version-1&2), the present algorithm (version-3, Mishra et al, 2018) is significantly different both in terms of surface reflectance characterization as well as aerosol inversion. The updated algorithm has several advancement, which has improved the AOD product. Following points are some of the important features of the present
