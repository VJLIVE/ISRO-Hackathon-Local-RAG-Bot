Study of Monsoon Onset over Kerala during 2023 using satellite observations Region: 50°E:65°E 0°N:10°N Peak of TPW: 11 May 2023 Prediction of Onset: 29 May 2023 (after 18 days from peak of TPW, ±4 days) Formation of MJO over Equatorial Indian Ocean during pre-monsoon 2023 Pentad Wind at 850 hPa during pre-monsoon month of 2023 The wind reversal over equator can be seen and the westerly wind got stronger after the peak TPW achieved. Conclusion • A peak of TPW over the Arabian Sea (50°E:65°E; 0°N:10°N) is occurred 18 days prior to Onset at Kerala. • MJO start forming at the same time over equatorial Indian Ocean. • The monsoon wind (wind reversal over equator and strong westerly wind) over Arabian Sea into Indian landmass started after the peak of TPW observed. • The Onset process get disturbed if cyclone formed during the said period (a case of 2021). • The present analysis lead to the conclusion that the Onset may occurred on 29 May 2023 with a error of ±4 days. • Due to the cyclone present in Bay of Bengal, we would like to observe the situation for another couple of days before giving the final prediction.
