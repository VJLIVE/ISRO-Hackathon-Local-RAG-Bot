surfaces. The major reason is that we do not have a good understanding of the directional reflectance properties of various surface types at the INSAT-3D Imager resolution. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 40 3.4.2. Generation of narrow to broadband albedo conversion coefficients Once the database is created from the simulations described above, the next step is to link TOA reflectance to land surface broadband albedos. This exercise is to be carried out for each of the major land cover types. We used regression analysis to establish the linear relationship (equation 4) between TOA reflectance in two bands of INSAT-3D Imager and LSA and to obtain the arrow to broadband (NtoB) conversion coefficients C0, C1, and C2. Where is the broadband LSA, while 3D-VIS and 3D-SWIR are the TOA reflectances in visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor respectively. A set of NtoB coefficients are computed for four major land covers namely, soil, vegetation, water and snow. The physical meaning of the conversion factors C1 and C2 is obvious from equation (4). They quantify the ratio of the reflected radiances within the narrow bands to the reflected radiances for the visible and SWIR broad bands, or the degree of the representativeness of the narrowband reflectance for the broadband reflectance. The conversion coefficients developed from extensive radiative transfer simulations are then would be applied to the INSAT-3D Imager TOA reflectance data. 3.4.3. Calibration of the TOA observations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor It has been observed that the satellite-level signal in two spectral bands of the INSAT-3D Imager instrument significantly underestimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values. This factor severely modulates the LSA computations. An exercise was carried out to compensate this factor of underestimation from a systematic comparison between TOA radiances of INSAT-3D Imager and INSAT-3A CCD and MODIS sensors. After
