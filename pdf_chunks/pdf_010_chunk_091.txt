more important factor than drop size distribution. A composite picture emerging out of various studies in the past has proved the main factors governing cloud brightness are:  thickness  the area to volume ratio  orientation of solar beam These factors collectively called geometry, determine optical path within the cloud. Drop size distribution and liquid water content are secondary in importance. Background albedo may be significant over land areas. Interactions apparently are important when clouds are close together. The phase is not appears to be an important variable. The proposed method is the H-E method as developed at NOAA/NESDIS. The details of this method are described in the next section. Retrieval Algorithm Method The H-E method described in this section is based on pre-prints of a paper by Kuligowaski et al. (2003). This paper is received from the author through personal communication. The H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-E method, the relationship between 10.7 m brightness temperature (Tb10.7) and rain rate (mm h-1) (R) is defined as: R = a exp(-bTb 12 10.7), -----(1) Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 73 where, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 (Vicente et al. 1995). The A-E method provides same relationship for convective and non- convective precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value. In H-E method, convective and non-convective cores are identified and different R-Tb relationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the convective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and b are varied as per precipitable water (PW) provided by Eta model. This allows higher precipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained such a way that it yields
