For SOUNDER Visible Band Radiance is included in place of Albedo 1 Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1 Scope The document describes the format layout of Sounder and Imager INSAT-3D Digital Data Products provided in HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format) and Keyhole Markup Language (KML). These include Standard and Geophysical Parameters provided in HDF5 Format and KML. This format document is valid for Level-1, Level-2 and Level-3 products. 1.2 Purpose and Objectives This document serves as a format document for the INSAT-3D data products in HDF5 Format. The reader should note that this document does not discuss the structures underlying HDF or the specific conventions employed. For more information on HDF, its design philosophy, and its logical and physical formats, the reader is referred to NCSA website [1]. The HDF5 library and utilities (provided by NCSA) can be used to read the contents of the HDF products. 1.3 INSAT-3D Payloads The INSAT-3D spacecraft (parked at 82° East) carries two meteorological payloads: (i) Imager working from the visible to the infrared spectral bands (0.55 to 12.5 µm) and (ii) Sounder working in 18 IR (7 in LWIR,5 in MWIR,6 in SWIR) channels and one in Visible spectral range. Brief specification of Imager and Sounder are as follows. IMAGER The IMAGER provides imaging capability of the earth disk from geostationary altitude in one Visible (VIS) in 0.55 to 0.75 µm range and five infrared channels. The specifications of the payload are summarized in Table 1.2.1. There are two flexible modes of operations possible with the IMAGER payloads:  Full frame mode scans 18° E-W x 18°N-S covering the entire earth disk
