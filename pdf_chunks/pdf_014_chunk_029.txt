in forests, 5.6 g/kg (PM2.5) and 84 g/kg (CO) in shrublands, 9.5 g/kg (PM2.5) and 90 g/kg (CO) in grasslands, and 5.7 g/kg (PM2.5) and 70 g/kg (CO) in croplands. Although INSAT-3D/R satellites observe the surface every 15â€“30 min, observations of diurnal fires may, to a great extent, be obstructed by the impact factors including cloud cover, canopy cover, heavy fire smoke, heterogeneity of the surface, large pixel size and view angle of satellites, and weak energy release from fire pixels (Giglio et al., 2003; Prins and Menzel, 1992; Roberts et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, missing FRP observations cause a great amount of gaps in the spatial and temporal distributions. As a result, FRE in a given time period and region is not able to be directly integrated from satellite-observed FRP. To overcome these limitations, the diurnal patterns of FRP need to be reconstructed, which will be done by using a climatological value of FRP between t1 and t2 as exemplified in fig.1. Since, we will be giving products only over forests therefore, different forest density classes and forest types will be considered for making efforts in simulating diurnal FRP climatology. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 29 Fig.1. Climatological diurnal FRP (average data from 2002 to 2005) for various ecosystems in North America (Zhang et al., 2012) To do this, we will adopt the approach that was originally developed to reconstruct diurnal pattern of fire size (Zhang and Kondragunta, 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). The climatological FRP will be calculated for forest types and their density classes, separately. These FRP data in a half-hourly interval will be smoothed using statistical fittings. The offset of shift is determined from the data pairs of the detected FRP for the given fire pixel and the corresponding values in the
