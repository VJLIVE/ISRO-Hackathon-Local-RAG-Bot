possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance for other land covers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be generated using AWiFS sensor. The NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values observed in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested pixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, yet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., 1998). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water from snow. 6.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of the spectrum. While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds have high reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold value and will be used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will further be improved due to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al., 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D derived product. This will
