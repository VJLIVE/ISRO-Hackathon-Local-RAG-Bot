Positions of four channels of the Imager payload are also shown in the graph (source: Pandya et al., 2011a) The SW technique is particularly favoured for its simplicity and robustness. In most cases, the SW LST algorithms simultaneously convert brightness temperature to skin temperature, given the estimates of the surface spectral emissivity. A review of the SW technique and published SW algorithms can be found in Li et al., (2013). The SW algorithm selected and proposed for this study is given by (Li et al., 2013; Sobrino et al., 1994) equation (4) and it is modified in the present study for varying view zenith angles for the Imager sensor (section 3.1),         d a a T T a T T a T a a T j i j i i s . 1 . . . . 6 5 2 4 3 2 1          (4) Where Ti and Tj are the at-sensor brightness temperatures at the SW bands i and j (in Kelvin),  is the mean emissivity, j),  is the emissivity difference,  =(j) and a1 to a6 are the SW coefficients to be determined from simulation data. 18.4 Method and Data Used in the Study 18.4.1 Methodology A flowchart depicting the steps followed in the proposed algorithm is shown in the figure 4.
