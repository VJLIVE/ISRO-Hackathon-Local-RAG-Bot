and near sufficient space- time sampling, and polar passive microwave radiometers viz. more physically based retrievals, are synergistically used to generate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g. Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. The technique has the following components: 1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m- 6.7m), which corresponds well with rainfall. 2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain baring clouds. 3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR – TB’s. 4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness temperatures colder than 240K. 5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / SSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. 6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top brightness temperature ( 11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds along with Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave Imager-TMI). Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 49 7. To adjust the rainfall estimates in association with the product of Integrated Precipitable water and Relative Humidity from 500 mb – Surface (from Eta/IMD model). 8. Validation of rainfall with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of algorithm. 9. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid scales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm. 4.3 Inputs 4.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) The details for the required satellite data for both GPI and IMSRA are provided in following table: Parameter Resolution Quantization
