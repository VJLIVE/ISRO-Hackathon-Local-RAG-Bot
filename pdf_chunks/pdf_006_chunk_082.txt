to sustaining the livelihood of many countries. Excess rainfall can cause flood, property and crop damages. A deficiency causes drought and crop failure. Flood is a disaster that often resulted from intense precipitation in short time. Floods are among the most devastating national hazards in the world, claiming more lives and causing more property damage than any other natural phenomena. Within the USA an average of more than 225 people are killed and more than $3.5 billion in property is damaged by heavy rain and flooding each year (1993, 1999). These figures are more devastating for India with population over 1 billion. As of today, the floods is one the greatest challenges in weather prediction. Conventionally rainfall over the ground is measured using rain gauges and radar. Rain gauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of the precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of the rain gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of various rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, etc. On the other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their coverage is limited due to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to poor calibration of radar reflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based observation network often failed to work. In view of the limitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large area is by using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer frequent uniform coverage over large area. However, the satellite measurements also suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR methods suffer from their inability to sense
