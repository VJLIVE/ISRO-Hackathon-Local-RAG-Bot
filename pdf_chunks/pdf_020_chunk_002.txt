INSAT-3D AOD ATBD version-1&2), the present algorithm (version-3, Mishra et al, 2018) is significantly different both in terms of surface reflectance characterization as well as aerosol inversion. The updated algorithm has several advancement, which has improved the AOD product. Following points are some of the important features of the present algorithm that makes it advanced and improved in comparison to previous versions: a) Previous algorithm utilizes single scattering approximation (SSA) that is it do not consider multiple scattering, while in present algorithm exact radiative transfer calculation are done considering multiple scattering events also. Aerosol b) In previous versions, minimization of 30-day top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance is assumed as surface contribution, while here minimization of Rayleigh corrected TOA reflectance is used for generating clear composite image (CCI). c) In previous version CCI image is directly used as surface reflectance, while in present algorithm CCI image is first atmospherically corrected using dynamic (seasonal and spatial) background aerosol database (generated using multiyear MODIS aqua AOD data) to generate surface reflectance which is then used for AOD inversion. d) Previously perfectly scattering aerosol type is assumed for both ocean and land (for land it is rarely valid), while in updated algorithm for AOD inversion continental and marine aerosols are used for land and ocean, respectively. e) In previous versions, AOD retrieval done for all pixel even over bright surface where in principle retrieval is not possible using band centered at red (650nm) wavelength, while in current version AOD retrieval is done only for those pixel where surface reflectance is less than critical reflectance. Thus, false retrievals such as AOD retrieval over very bright surface (like desert or bare arid soil surfaces or high reflecting urban setups) are reduced/masked. f) Current algorithm gives AOD product at 550 nm.
