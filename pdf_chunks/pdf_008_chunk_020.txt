Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region (Fig. 15 (b)), which otherwise it is not able to capture in Fig. 15(a). Fig. 15: Rain on 04 September 2014 at 1500 UTC from (a) without modification, and (b) with modification. The J&K state averaged H-E rain from modified algorithm for week from 3-10 September 2014 is found to be of 245.78 mm which is very close to the IMD WWR provided rain of 267.7 mm. For the same week TRMM-3B42 V7 provides corresponding rain value of 95.33 mm. Thus the H-E rain from modified algorithm is better representative of intense rain in J&K during 3-10 September 2014 then TRMM 3B42 V7. (b) (a) (b) (a) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 18 The above two case studies of very intense rain over hilly terrain gives us confidence that the modifications in H-E method as described in section 5.0, give more representative rain values over Hilly terrain. Further validations are carried out of the modified algorithm in different spatial and temporal scales with IMD daily gridded, weekly met-subdivision averaged (from WWR) rain values, and also with TRMM 3B42 V7, which is an IR and microwave merged product. We have computed the H-E rain from modified algorithm for 10 week period from 3 July to 10 September 2014. The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly basis and compared with rain values provided by IMD in WWR. A scatter plot of comparison is shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 16: Comparison of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged rain from H-E and IMD WWR for 10 weeks from 3 July to 10 September 2014. The Fig. 16 when compared with Fig. 5 (a), shows a marked improvement in the comparison of H-E rain with WWR rain values, both in terms of correlation as well as standard deviation of their difference.
