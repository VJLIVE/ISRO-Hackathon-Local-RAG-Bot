In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of smoke. 9.4.1 Overview 9.4.1.1 Theoretical Background Identification of smoke through satellite observations is a challenge in itself. The large spectral overlap in the spectral signature smoke and other scene types such as clouds and background surfaces has complicated the problem. Till date, very few studies have been done to discriminate smoke in a satellite imagery. The most commonly used method of identifying smoke is to assign different colors to different channels or channel combinations. The resulting false-color images can
