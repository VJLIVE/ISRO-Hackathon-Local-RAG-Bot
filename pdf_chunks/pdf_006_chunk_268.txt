of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those targets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude lower than 600 hPa). This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous Infrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). Once the mid-infrared tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as the final height. 14.4.1.1.5 Tracking If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the
