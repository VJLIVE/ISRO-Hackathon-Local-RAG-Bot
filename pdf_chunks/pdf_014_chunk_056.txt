multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS. The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at hourly intervals up to 72 hours. Similarly, IMD is also running a WRF model in a double domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 9 km and 3 km for the RSMC Domain and All India domain respectively. The model has 46 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 50 hPa. In this algorithm only temperature and relative humidity at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of ET. For testing the prototype algorithm, SAC WRF forecasts at 5km resolution will be used. However, for operational implementation in MMDRPS, IMD WRF forecasts will be used. 4.3. Inputs 4.3.1.
