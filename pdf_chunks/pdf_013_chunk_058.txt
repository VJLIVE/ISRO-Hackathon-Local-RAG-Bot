This method is referred to as the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC). This method can be used by simultaneously solving four state equations as mentioned by (Mallick et.al. 2014) to estimate latent heat flux. The four internal state equations needs to be solved in iterative manner to compute LE are given below: …Ö =   ∆≥(  ) (3) ‚àÜT =   ∆≥ ( …Ö …Ö ) (4) gs = gB  ‚àó   (5) gB =  ∆ç (‚àÜ  !"#!$ ∆≥ ) (6) Here …Ö is the evaporative fraction, ‚àÜT is expressed as Ts-Ta where Ta (oC) is the air temperature and Ts is land surface temperature (oC).
