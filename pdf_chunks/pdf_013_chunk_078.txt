Operational product of WRF short-range forecast Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation model with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 68 initial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from India such as Oceansat-2 scatterometer wind data and other International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast). The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at hourly interval upto 72 hours. In this algorithm only temperature at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of Rn. Parameters Source Operational hourly forecast output from WRF at 0.05° x 0.05° spatial resolution for the following parameters in ASCII format (latitude, longitude, parameter) a) Air temperature (K)
