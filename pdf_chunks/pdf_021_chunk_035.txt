flow chart 1 (Fig. 17). In the modified scheme, new HEM removes the program for atmospheric thermo dynamics and includes the necessary model equations in the main body of HEM itself. The modified HEM also takes histogram equalization matched up files for each of the height bins of the parameter (TPW/RH) at surface to given elevation bin as static input files. The only change in input to HEG is that in modified program for H-E rain, it also takes as input to Earth elevation model file (ETOPO2).This is shown in Fig. 18.

SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 28 9.0 Domain and the format of output The output is provided in terms of geolocation (latitude and longitude) and rain rate in mm/h. The area of coverage is latitude: 30oE to 130o E, and longitude: 50o S to 50o N. 10.0 Acknowledgement Authors are thankful to Dr. Robert Koligowaski, NOAA/STAR for his unconditional support to develop H-E at SAC.
