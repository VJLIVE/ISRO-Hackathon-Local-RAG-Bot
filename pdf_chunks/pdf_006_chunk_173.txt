of electromagnetic radiation. This absorption reduces transmittance of that radiation through the smoke. The effect of smoke aerosol as function of wavelength forms the crux of its satellite detection algorithm. Smoke has a large effect in the visible part of the spectrum, decreasing in magnitude with wavelength from the blue to the red region. In the near IR the effect is smaller than the variation in the surface reflectance between the smoke free area and the area affected by smoke. The smoke effect is not observable in the mid IR (2.2 Âµm) region due to the large ratio of the wavelength of radiation to the size of particles. Thus using visible channel it is possible to distinguish smoke plumes over land. But the diffusion processes associated with smoke and clouds lead to fuzzy boundaries between them. Hence although the reflectance of smoke is generally less than that of clouds, the latter has so large a range of variation that it is difficult to use it to discriminate smoke pixels from cloudy pixels. Thus the biggest challenge in smoke detection is to isolate smoke from a smoke/ Haze/ Cloud mix in a satellite imagery. Discrimination between smoke and clouds is generally made on the basis of cloud classification. Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 145 The channels Visible, MIR, TIR-1, TIR-2 of the INSAT-3D imager exhibit some distinction in the characteristics of smoke, clouds and underlying surface which is the basis of smoke identification. Algorithm Overview The smoke detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding technique, which includes single and multi band difference thresholds, corrected albedo calculations, sun glint mask and cloud edge detection. It first eliminates Smoke/ Cloud/ Haze free pixels and then screens out different kinds of cloudy pixels to arrive at smoke pixels. In general, the reflectance and brightness
