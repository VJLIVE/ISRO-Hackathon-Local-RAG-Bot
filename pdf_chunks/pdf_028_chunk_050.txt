extensively over different regions and seasons of the year so that complete dynamic range of the parameters could be validated. We expect a separate team will be looking for the validation aspect. We, however, need their feedback for fine tuning the retrieval algorithms in the post launch phase. 3.10 Future Scope Retrieval algorithms have to be validated and then if necessary fine tuning of the algorithms have to be carried out. This will be done by adjusting the coefficients in the D-matrix by minimizing the errors between observations and the estimations. 3.11 References Alishouse, J.C., S. Synder, J. Vongsathorn, and R.R.
