need to fine-tune the existing SA algorithms in order to account for the variations in specific absorption coefficient, which would allow the retrieval of bio-optical parameters (e.g., Chl-a) simultaneously in both Case-1 and Case-2 waters. One of the important parameters that affects the retrieval of bio-optical constituents, in optically complex waters, is the slope S of acdm(λ). Meler et al. 2016 explained the distribution of the CDM slope (S) as a function of acdm(440). It is was shown to be nonlinearly related to CDM absorption coefficient (Meler et al. 2016; Kowalczuk et al., 2006) and governs the spectral shape of acdm(λ). The CDM-absorption affects the attenuation of light in ultraviolet (UV) and blue wavelengths thereby shielding the aquatic life from harmful UV radiation (Wei et al., 2016). In this study, we propose a SA approach with improved CDOM slope estimate for calculating bio-optical parameters with good accuracy in optically complex waters. 3. Datasets 3.1 NASA Bio-optical marine algorithm datasets (NOMAD) The relationship between CDOM slope “S” (1/nm) and CDOM absorption coefficient ag at 443 nm was established based on the combined data set of NOMAD and Indian coastal data as shown in Fig- 3 & 4. 3.2 Validation data set Chilika Lagoon is a good site to study optically complex waters. Chilika lagoon on the east coast of India (19028’ N – 190 54’ N; 850 06’ E−850 35’ E) is one of the important wetlands in the country and is the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia. In the northern side of the lagoon, tributaries of the Mahanadi River such as Daya, Nuna, and Bhargavi bring a lot of sediment and freshwater influx with terrestrial inputs into the lagoon. Fig. 2.
