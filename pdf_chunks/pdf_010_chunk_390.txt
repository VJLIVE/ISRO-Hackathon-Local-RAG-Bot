The equation was developed by linearizing Beer's radiation extinction law as a function of station elevation and assuming that the average angle of the sun above the horizon is about 50o.For areas of high turbidity caused by pollution or airborne dust or for regions where the sun angle is significantly less than 50o so that the path length of radiation through the atmosphere is increased, an adaption of Beer’s law can be employed where P is used to represent atmospheric mass:         Sin K P R R t a SO * 0018 .0 exp t K = turbidity coefficient, 0 < Kt ≤ 1.0 where Kt = 0.0 for clean air and Kt = 1.0 for extremely trubid, dusty or polluted air.
