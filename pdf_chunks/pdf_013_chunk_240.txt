Algorithm functional specifications In 1948, Penman combined the energy balance with the mass transfer and derived an equation to compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard meteorological records of sunshine, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This combination method was further extended to vegetated surface by introducing resistance term. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have been added to the original equation of Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) from INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 206 a surface. This formulation is referred as FAO-56 Penman and Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) ETo for a day. This is treated as standardized model worldwide.
