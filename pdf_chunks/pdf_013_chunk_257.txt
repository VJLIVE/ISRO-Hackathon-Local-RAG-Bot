data in various applications on different time scales with known errors. Figure 9. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation 17.7.1.4. Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere Considering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial ETo as no regular spatial record are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) attempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o x 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS operational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 225 retrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with lysimeter data and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean. Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS equipped with humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using FAO-56 P-M method. They used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al. 2004). The study found that most of the errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to uncertainties in retrieving daily solar radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 1.32 mm (11% to 110% from daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of ETo mean value) at 0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ETo mean value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational product of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05°grid for estimation of ETo at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was
