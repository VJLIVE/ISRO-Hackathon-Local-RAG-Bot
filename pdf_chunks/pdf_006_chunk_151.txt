This techniques need two end members representing the visible reflectance of a completely snow-covered and completely snow-free land surface, Rsnow and Rland, respectively. F = (R-Rland) / (Rsnow-Rland) Where, R is the observed visible reflectance of the scene. The reflectance of snow free land in every grid cell of the map will be established from satellite data obtained during snow free season. The reflectance of snow assumed to be independent of location and determined empirically from satellite data or from field reflectance observations. Previous investigations have shown that snow fraction retrievals was unreliable over mountainous area due to frequent specular reflectance effects on satellite observed visible reflectance (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). Attempt will be made to resolve this problem by using concepts mentioned above as local illumination angle correction, Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function and multiple data analysis in a day. 7.4.1.1.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOW FRACTION AND DEPTH Romanov and Tarpley, (2004) have developed a statistical relationship between satellite observed snow fraction and field observed snow depth. For this purpose field snow depth data of 1400 locations in Great Plains of USA and Canadian Prairies were analyzed. During matching observations, to reduce the effect of possible inhomogeneity of the snow depth distribution and inaccuracy of gecoding, snow fraction was averaged 3 x 3 grid. For development of this technique, forested region was exclude. A statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction
