on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. Much of the uncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully be improved. Recent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed improvement in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of real-time satellite based other land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture would definitely help in improving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work should address the retrieval / estimation of those variables from Indian geostationary satellites. The INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. This would reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation.
