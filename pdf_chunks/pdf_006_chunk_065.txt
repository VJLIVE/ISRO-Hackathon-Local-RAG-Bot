across the scan). Based on G and S the decision is made about the cirrus delineation. There are many channels needed for this screening procedure and has been originally developed only for mid latitudes, we are aware of a more recent cloud classification approach by CNES as an alternative (Roca et al. 2002). This method is based on classification of clear sky, low clouds, warm semitransparent clouds, mid-to-upper level clouds or without thin cirrus above, mid-to-upper level clouds, and finally deep convection with or without thin cirrus above. Step 2: Micro-physical properties of clouds: During the day time when the visible channel is available and the radiance at 3.9 mm is dominated by the solar reflected part, the effective radius of cloud particles at the cloud tops can be computed for overcast pixels. As stated by Ba and Gruber (2001), the first step in deriving the effective particle radius consists of selecting only pixels filled with optically thick clouds because measurements obtained from thin clouds include radiances both emitted and reflected by clouds. For optically thick clouds defined as having a visible reflectance greater than 0.40, the transmissivity at 3.9mm wavelength can be neglected. So with the assumption that the cloud is a Lambertian surface, the emissivity can be expressed by 1 - A, where A is the spectral albedo at 3.9 mm. Thus, the observed radiance L at 3.9 mm is then given by L = AS0/π + (1-A) PEBB (3) where So is the solar irradiance in the GOES 3.9-J.l0l band and PEBB is the equivalent blackbody emitted thermal radiation at 3.9 mm for cloud-top temperature T,. Thus, the albedo A is obtained from Eq. (4): A = L – PEBB /(S0/ π - PEBB) (4) The effective radius of cloud particles is defined as where N(r) is
