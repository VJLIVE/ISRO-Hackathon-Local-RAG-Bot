in the table-1. A flat elliptical scan mirror mounted at 45 to the optical axis intercepts the radiation and reflects it on to 310mm reflective telescope. At the telescope, dichroic beam splitters separate the visible spectrum and three IR coarse bands. The three IR bands then pass through the concentric ring of a cold filter wheel maintained at a low temperature (- 230C) to limit the background radiation. Channel filters on the filter wheel provide sequential sampling of defined narrow band spectral channels. There are three concentric rings on the filter wheel, each catering to a coarse band. Each of the rings is further divided in to a number of sectors each housing filter for a channel. Detector arrays for each coarse band consist of four elements arranged in north-south direction. Thus the combined IFOV of the arrays is 280 (E-W) x 1120 (N-S) R2. The IR detectors are mounted inside the radiant cooler and cooled to cryogenic temperature of less than 100K for improving noise performance detectors. The temperature of the detectors is maintained at fixed value using temperature sensors and heaters in a servo-loop. The scan mirror operates in step and dwell mode to facilitate sequential sounding. The east-west step size of scan mirror will be 280µR (10km). At each step, the mirror dwells for 0.1 second to allow completion of full spectral coverage through filter wheel drive. After completing acquiring data in all bands, the mirror steps in north south direction by 1120 µR (40 km). The rotation of the filter wheel is synchronized to the mirror stepping so that the mirror remains stationary during the sounding. To optimize efficiency, both forward and reverse scans are used for data collection. In addition to full earth disc coverage, flexible programme modes are provided to cater to different coverage
