The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at three hourly interval upto 72 hours. Examples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast product of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over Indian region are shown in Figure 1.
