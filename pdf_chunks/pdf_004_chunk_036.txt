flagging. The SD values for rain-free and under low to moderate rain conditions are overlapping which primarily lead to such rain events undetected. However, apart from this, another useful clue used here is that the retrieved wind directions under rainy situations are mostly found to be around directions normal to the sub-satellite track. Thus a criterion is chosen to flag out possible raining situations in the data based on the above 31 information. The trends of wind speed binned mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD with corresponding wind speed are established for all WVC as shown in figure (16b). The nonlinearly fitted mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD are used for rain flagging (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001). The rank-1 retrieved wind vector solution is assumed to be referring to raining condition if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) the retrieved wind speed WS1 PRCN is above 7.0 m/s, 2) the difference of retrieved wind direction χ1 PRCN with direction normal to sub-satellite track (∆χ1 PRCN) satisfies the condition |Cos(∆χ1 PRCN)| ≤ 0.275 and, 3) the difference of observed SD1 PRCN and calculated rain- free SDRFAVG satisfies the condition ∆SD1 PRCN > 0.7.MSD.SDRFSD, with ∆SD1 PRCN = |SD1 PRCN - SDRFAVG|, while SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are given by SDRFAVG = Σ 3 Q=0AQ( WS1 PRCN)Q and SDRFSD = Σ 3 Q=0DQ( WS1 PRCN)Q 23 where, AQ and DQ are the polynomial coefficients for average (solid line through “ diamond” symbols) and standard deviation (dotted line through “ plus” symbols) fitted curves of SD, respectively, as shown in figure (16b). The fitted curves used for calculating SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are shown in figure (16b). The threshold multiplier MSD varying from 1.8 to 2.2 is used for rain detection and has impact on rain detection under rain-free and rainy situations as
