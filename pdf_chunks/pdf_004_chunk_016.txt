so far. More so, variants of MLE algorithm have also been developed (Stoffelen and Anderson, 1997; Stoffelen and Portabella, 2006) with difference in its implementation. In some of the variants of MLE, a transformed MLE has also been developed. The algorithm developed recently is based on transformed MLE, which is as good as MLE but is computationally efficient. This recently developed algorithm is described here. The cost function used in MLE algorithm (Pierson, 1989), is given as MLCF(Wk, χk) = Σ M i=1{(σ0M(φi, θi, pi) - σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)) / Kpij.σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)}2 4 Where, σ0M is backscatter measured by ith scatterometer antenna beam at incidence angle θi, polarization pi with azimuth direction φi, σ0G is backscatter calculated from GMF for a trial wind speed Wj and trial kth wind direction χk, ϕki is relative wind direction taken as ϕki = χk- φi and φi is antenna azimuth direction from North direction. For an assumed wind direction, the cost function MLCF is minimized by using simulated backscatter for varying wind speed Wj with a suitable increment and the 14 nonlinear interpolation. The minimum of MLCF is dependent on the wind speed search interval. As smallest is the interval (more computations) precise is the minimum. This process can also be realized using individual minimization for which the MLCF is transformed from backscatter space to the wind speed space and is referred here as normalized variance (NV) given by NVk = Σ M i=1{(Wki - Wk) / Kpi Wk}2 5 Where Wki is a wind speed derived from ith measurement σ0M(φi, θi, pi) while Wk is a best (but with errors) wind speed to which all measurements are associated with. In this recent approach, a given backscatter observation σ0M(φi, θi, pi) is converted into wind speed Wki for an assumed
