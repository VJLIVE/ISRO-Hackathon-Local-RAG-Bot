Distribution Processing centers perform functions such as science data processing, data verification and orbit determination. There are three levels of processed data: • Telemetry data (raw data or level0) • Sensor Data Records (engineering units or level1) • Geophysical Data Records (geophysical units or level2) There are two kinds of data processing and distribution: • Real-time processing and distribution (EUMETSAT and ISRO/NRSC) The operational geophysical data record (OGDR) is available with a latency of 3-5 hours. Note that this is a non-validated product that uses orbits computed by the on-board DORIS Navigator (DIODE) and that does not contain all the environmental/geophysical corrections. • Delayed-mode processing and distribution (CNES and ISRO/SAC) The interim geophysical data record (IGDR) is available per pass with a latency of less than 1.5 days. Note that this is not a fully validated product, although it uses a preliminary orbit and includes all the environmental/geophysical corrections (preliminary for some of them). This product is generated by CNES only. The geophysical data record (GDR) is a fully validated product that uses a precise orbit and the best environmental/geophysical corrections. This product is available per repeat cycle with a latency of 40 days. Validation is performed by CNES teams to ensure in depth validation. GDR products are generated both by CNES and ISRO/SAC. Geophysical data records are disseminated to users as they become available, as well as ingested in two main archives (at CNES and ISRO), where they are made available to the scientific community, ISRO being in charge of data dissemination to Indian community and CNES to the rest of the scientific community. The NRT and offline data are provided through different sources and means as discussed below. Note that the telemetry acquisition strategy, designed to minimize the risk of science data loss, sometimes results in files containing
