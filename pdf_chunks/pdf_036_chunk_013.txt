to fulfill the objectives of the mission. The T/P follow-on mission, Jason-1, was engaged soon after with the aim to provide the same level of performance, but with a significant decrease in weight and power needs, hence a much lower mission cost. In addition, near-real time applications were included in the main objectives of the mission. Jason-2 presents better tracking performance and continue the success story of altimetric missions. These missions, individually as well as combined have made essential contributions in other domains, like mean sea level surveys, tides, marine meteorology, geophysics and geodesy. Most notably the tandem mission phase, where Jason-1 and T/P or Jason-1 and Jason-2 were flying on the same orbit separated by only 70 s or 1 min, provided a unique opportunity for intercalibration of both systems, hence improving further the scientific data quality. High accuracy radar altimeter missions are uniquely capable to globally and continuously observe the ocean and to better understand the short to long term changes of ocean circulation. They are now considered as essential components of global ocean observation systems. These systems integrate altimetric and other satellite and in-situ data into models and require the continuity and permanence of ocean measurements to produce time series over several decades. The near-real time and short term capability of Jason-1, Jason-2 as well as ENVISAT (from ESA, launched in March 2002) have fed several pilot experiments that demonstrated the growing importance of operational ocean observation products and short-range ocean prediction for a variety of applications (ship routing, environmental hazards, support to maritime industries). Also worth mentioning is the importance of wave and wind data provided by altimeter systems over oceans. This information is routinely used in meteorological and research entities, either for calibration of other data sets, assimilation in weather and wave models, or for
