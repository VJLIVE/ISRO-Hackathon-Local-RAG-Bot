A2 Cos(2ϕ)+ A3 Cos(3ϕ) where Y = (σ0/A0)–1 3 At desired incidence angle, polarization and wind speed, by determining Y at each ϕ value, the harmonic coefficients Ai are established through statistical analysis. This procedure yields the GMF coefficients as well as an idea about the scatterometer data quality. It is important that for each bin of wind speed the wind direction corresponding to radar backscatter should have uniform distribution with statistical significance while for any bin of relative wind direction the wind speed should have Rayleigh distribution (Wentz et al, 1984). Thus, it requires a large database of simultaneous backscatter and wind vector measurements in order to meet this requirement for GMF development. Moreover, the data should also be for rain free situations requiring simultaneous observations of rain. As a prelude to GMF development, analysis of Quikscat data (MGDR NRT Version in BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for orbit #29820 on March 11, 2005 at 12.00 GMT is performed. Figure (4) shows the scatter plot of Quikscat radar backscatter with relative wind direction obtained making use of NCEP model winds provided along with the data.

The A0 coefficients for selected wind speed values are derived from the above Quikscat data as depicted in figure (5). A comparison of derived A0 from the data set and from the Quikscat GMF QSCAT-1 is also depicted. The observed difference between GMF and data derived A0 coefficient is quite evident due to incompleteness of the observation set.
