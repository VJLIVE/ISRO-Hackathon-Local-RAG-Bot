FRP will be calculated for forest types and their density classes, separately. These FRP data in a half-hourly interval will be smoothed using statistical fittings. The offset of shift is determined from the data pairs of the detected FRP for the given fire pixel and the corresponding values in the climatological curve using a least square method. Because fires in a pixel may not last for a very long time and instantaneous fires are not continuously detected due to the impacts from cloud cover, smoke, low severity fires releasing limited fire energy, and other factors (Zhang et al., 2011), the fire duration will be determined by assuming that fire could be extended 2 hours prior and post instantaneous fire detections if the number of the fire detections within a day is more than three times for the same pixel. Otherwise, fire occurrences are based on actual satellite detections. Finally, total FRE will be computed which is the time integral of fire radiative power (FRP) and FRE has correlation between PM 2.5 concentrations and other emissions. …………………………..(3) where ts is the start time of a fire event and te is the end time of the fire pixel. For a given material one may assert that the total FRE of a fire is directly related to mass consumed by that material’s heat of combustion, which can then be related to PM 2.5 and other emissions (Kaufman et al., 1998; Wooster et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2005). INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 30 Because the temporal resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR will range from 15 (together) to 30 min (alone), we will set a minimum time step as 30 min. This means that we will calculate FRE by assuming that a fire can last for at least a half hour if there is
