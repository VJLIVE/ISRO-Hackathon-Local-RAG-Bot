here employs multi-thresholding technique, which includes single and multi band difference thresholds, corrected albedo calculations, sun glint mask and cloud edge detection. It first eliminates Smoke/ Cloud/ Haze free pixels and then screens out different kinds of cloudy pixels to arrive at smoke pixels. In general, the reflectance and brightness temperature of dense smoke have intermediate values between those of clouds and land. The reflectance of smoke is usually less than that of clouds, but higher than that of the underlying surface, while the converse is true for brightness temperature So double sided thresholding is applied in form of these five pass tests. First pass Test: A first pass thresholding is done on the visible channel counts to limit values indicative of haze/cloud mix. Second pass Test: Second pass is albedo thresholding to further screen out cloud/ surface reflectance over land and water. Albedo Calculation for the VIS channel where A is the albedo, Lr is the radiance,  is the solar zenith angle and F0 is the incident radiance if the satellite were to look directly at the sun, which is computed as: where S is the spectral irradiance of the sun and w is the spectral response function for the channel. Third pass Test: Since sun glint often produces the same signature as smoke in visible imagery, regions with reflected solar angles less than a threshold value are not processed to avoid those areas affected by sun glint. Fourth pass Test: Thresholding on brightness temperature of MIR, TIR-1 and difference of these two channels is implemented to screen out opaque cirrus and stratus clouds. Since clouds usually have cold tops, they have low brightness temperatures in TIR-1 channel. Further the large difference in the brightness temperatures between the MIR and the TIR-1 channels due to the reflection of
