INSAT-3DS contains Water Vapour Channel at 4 km resolution Geo-Physical Parameter (L2P) 2 3SIMG_L2P_AMV Earlier L2P Geophysical Parameters for winds (IR, WV, MIR, VIS) were being provided as separate HDF products with following code 3RIMG_L2P_IRW 3RIMG_L2P_MRW 3RIMG_L2P_VSW 3RIMG_L2P_WVW Now all products are merged in a single HDF file 3SIMG_L2P_AMV Where during Day VIS winds will be provided and during Night MIR winds will be provided. IR and WV winds will be provided for all acquisitions. Binned Geo-Physical Parameters (Temporally Binned) L3B 1 3SIMG_L3B_SST The Daily SST from Variational (VAR) and Regression (REG) methods were being provided in two HDF files. Now these two parameters are merged in a single HDF file 2 3SIMG_L3B_LST The Daily binned MIN Temperature and MAX temperature were being provided in two HDF files. Now these two parameters are merged in a single HDF file 3 3SIMG_L3B_BRT Earlier all Channel Brightness temperature were being provided as separate HDF files. Now TIR1, TIR2, MIR and WV brightness temperature are being provided in a single file Binned Geo-Physical Parameters (Temporally Binned) L3C 1 3SIMG_L3C_INS Earlier INS (Insolation), DHI (Direct Horizontal Irradiance, DNI (Diffused Normal Irradiance), GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) were being provided as separate HDF files. Now all four parameters are being provided in a single HDF file INSAT-3DS Data Products 6 1.3 Product Change Management: INSAT-3DS
