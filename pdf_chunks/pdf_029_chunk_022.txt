signal (reflectance or radiance), respectively, for band cantered at wavelength λ and 𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛 stands for residual error. The satellite level modelled reflectance 𝜌𝑠𝑎𝑡 ∗ is estimated by linear mixing of satellite level modelled reflectance for fine mode and coarse mode aerosol models represented by symbols 𝜌λ,𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒 ∗ and 𝜌λ,𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 ∗ , respectively, and weighted by fine mode fraction 𝐹𝑀𝐹. Mathematically it can be represented by the relation: 𝜌λ ∗= 𝐹𝑀𝐹 𝜌λ,𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒 ∗ + (1 −𝐹𝑀𝐹)𝜌λ,𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 ∗ . (15) 19 4.4 Flowchart Figure 5. The overall workflow of the algorithm. 20 4.5 Operational Implementation Step 1: Reading visible channel radiance, sun-sensor geometry, and geolocation data. Step 2: Apply calibration coefficients to radiance data. Step 2: Down-sampling of each spectral band radiance by 3 x 3 window averaging. Step 3: Cloud masking, Saturation pixel masking, Inland water masking, Ocean masking. Step 4: Ozone correction to each channel radiance. Step 5: Surface characterization in blue channels. Step 6: LUT Interpolation. Step 7. Use LUTs for inversion of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine mode fraction. Step 8: Repeat steps 4 to 8 for each unmasked pixel. Step 9.
