The condition for the high zenith angle test is given by: 𝜃0 > 720 or 𝜃> 840 (7) 4.3.3 Physical basis and model for surface characterization The physical basis behind surface characterization in visible channels using NIR channels is based on the fact that over the vegetated surface, the surface reflectance in the blue spectral region is low due to absorption of solar radiation by chlorophyll while in the NIR region the surface reflectance becomes high due to specular reflection from the 16 leaves. Using this fact appropriate function of the form shown in equation 8 can be developed to characterize the surface reflectance in blue and red channels knowing the surface reflectance in NIR channels and an appropriate vegetation index. For the case of OCM-2 data, the vegetation index used is NDVI, blue and red, and NIR channels used are centered at 443 nm, 490 nm, 620 nm, and 865 nm. 𝜌𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟= 𝑓(𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟, 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼), (8) 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼= 𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟−𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟+𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 (9) 𝜌λ 𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟= 𝜌λ 𝑇𝑂𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺)−𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝜌λ 𝑅𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺,𝜏) 𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝑇(𝛺0,𝜏)𝑇(𝛺,𝜏)+𝑆λ(𝜏)[𝜌λ 𝑇𝑂𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺)−𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝜌λ 𝑅𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺,𝜏)] (10) For developing relation given in equation (8), around 1860 OCM-2 datasets (for the year 2017) were processed and corrected for aerosol and gas absorption at 22 AERONET stations (located in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar) using in-situ aerosol, water vapour, and ozone information. After cloud screening of both AERONET and OCM-2 data around 700 co- located data-points are selected for model development. Radiative transfer calculations were used to generate benchmark datasets of surface reflectance for each spectral channel. The performance of function developed to estimate band-3 and band-6 surface reflectance using NIR channel is shown in figure 3. From figure 3 it is seen that surface reflectance in band-3 can be estimated using both red as well as NIR bands and NDVI within
