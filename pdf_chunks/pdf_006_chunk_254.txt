the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. 13.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Calculate wind speed and direction. 13.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution U and V component of CMV m/sec 0 90 5-6 m/sec (upper level) 4-5 m/sec (lower level) -- Domain of output : 30oE – 130oE :: 50o S – 50o N 13.5.1 Format of the output and the domain As output of VIS wind the following parameters will be provided to IMD:  Zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors.  Latitudinal and longitudinal position.  Height of wind The format of the final product will be like this: 13.6 Validation 13.6.1 Data required Parameter Type Source Wind Collocated Radiosonde Profiles IMD Parameter Lat.

Quantitative assessment of the VIS winds product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting
