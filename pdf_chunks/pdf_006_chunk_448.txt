It is given by the formula 2 / 1 2 ] 2 30 ( [5 M L Q M Q Q T R H WI     Where WI – Maximum wind gust (knots, at the surface) HM – Height above ground of melting level (in km) RQ – QL/12 but not >1, QL – Mean mixing ratio (g/Kg) in lowest 1 km T – Lapse rate (oC km-1) from surface to melting level, QM – Mixing ratio at melting level. WI provides guidance on the maximum possible wind gusts that can occur with given atmospheric conditions, if convection were to occur. This is useful for generating short- range warnings and forecasts (Pryor et al., 2002). 6.2.2 Objective Calculate WI from INSAT sounder retrievals 6.3 Inputs 6.3.2 Dynamic Data Geopotential heights of standard pressure levels, temperature and humidity retrieved from the sounder. 6.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 6.4.1 Overview 6.4.1.1 Theoretical Background See section 6.2.1 6.4.2 Operational Implementation 1) From the retrieved temperature profile at standard pressure level, the pressure level
