Split-window coefficients shown as a function of view zenith angle In these calculations LST was treated as free parameter and regression was performed systematically by taking into account the dependency of  in the algorithm. The R2 values varied between 0.94 to 0.99 showing good correlation between modelled parameters in the split-window algorithm. 18.5.2 Sensitivity analysis In order to provide an estimation of the theoretical error on the estimated LST, and also the contribution of the different terms to that error, a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the classical error theory using derivatives. Hence, the contribution to the error on the LST, e(LST) is given by the following terms: 2 2 2 lg ) (        T NE a LST e (5) where alg is the standard error of the algorithm obtained in the minimization (standard error of estimation), NET is the contribution of the noise equivalent delta temperature (NET)
