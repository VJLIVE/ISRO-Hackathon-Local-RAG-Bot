Instrument and characteristics of input products 17.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D) The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system, which was launched at geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR (1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with nineteen sounder channel. The spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for MIR, WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the bands at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D data products scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 columns for Asia Mercator sector product. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 203 17.2.3.2. Operational insolation product A spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used to provide minimum ground brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to obtain daily
