is mathematically represented by the following expression:   Tb D G  *  Here, G is a vector whose elements are various geophysical parameters which is related to a measurement basis function vector φ(Tb) of simulated brightness temperatures Tb by a matrix D. The measurement basis function vector contains the elements which could either be pure or functions of TB. The matrix D is given by:         , , 1    C C D where C is a correlation matrix and is obtained from geophysical variables' statistics. Separate inversion coefficients are established for each geophysical variable. Different combinations of channels and polarization are required for different variable as the dependence of brightness temperature on these variables is different. Sensitivity studies and effect of errors in measurements on retrieval is also required for finalization of suitable combinations. Effect of Sensor-Satellite System errors on retrievals: As seen above that the retrieval coefficient matrix D is dependent on geophysical parameters as well as on the corresponding simulated brightness temperatures, the matrix D is affected by chosen statistics of geophysical parameters and on various errors in the brightness temperatures typical of a particular radiometer system and satellite attitude. It is always better for a stable retrieval to include the wide statistics of geophysical parameters and to account for various errors in the measurements of brightness temperatures by a radiometer and satellite attitude. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 37 The dominant errors in the brightness temperature measurements are the system noise at antenna and radiometer system, calibration, uncertainties in knowing the actual measurement geometry (viz. incidence angle and polarization etc). Thus knowledge of total error in measurements is must for establishing the retrieval matrix which enables to provide better estimates of geophysical parameters with known
