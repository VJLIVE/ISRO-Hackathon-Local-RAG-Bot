with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et al. 2006). This is possibly due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared region. Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for snowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). Various analysis techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this problem normalized difference snow index method is developed and discussed in this document. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has been effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al. 1995). INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 15 1.2.2. Remote Sensing of Snow Cover One of the earliest methods used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I
