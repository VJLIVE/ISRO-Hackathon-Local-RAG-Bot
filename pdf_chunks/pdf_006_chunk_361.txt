profiles from the SeeBor database used in the study. The water vapour content as a function of boundary layer temperature The band average emissivity values for various land cover types were used in the simulations with considering relative spectral response functions of INSAT 3D split channels (shown in figure 7). Figure 7. Emissivity for the different surface types considered in the simulation study Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 292 Coefficients for SW algorithm are derived from simulation data generated with the RT model MODTRAN. Specifically, the relationship between the model input LST and output top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature is fit with an LST algorithm (equation 4) via regression to obtain the required coefficients. 18.5 Results 18.5.1 Derivation of Split-Window Coefficients (SWC) The satellite-level signals in two TIR channels pertaining to Imager sensor were simulated for varying atmospheric and land surface properties discussed in the above sections. In order to determine the SWC a0 to a6 in Eq. (4), we divided the VZA into several tractable sub-ranges for improving the fitting accuracy and thus LST retrievals. Simulations were performed for VZA ranging from 0 to 60 degree taking into account the fact that the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D receives radiance from various VZA having varying atmospheric path length. The SW coefficients (a1 to a6) of Eq. (4) can be obtained through statistical regressions method for each VZA sub-range. Seven different sets of SWC were determined for each of this VZA sub-ranges, which are summarized in the table 3 and shown in the figure 8. Table 3.
