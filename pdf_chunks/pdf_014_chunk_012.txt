be seen when area is cloud covered. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore, discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55- 1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands, snow has lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has been successfully used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et al. 2006). Reflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi et al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose. Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component characteristic of forward scattering increases. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 16 1.2.3. Objective The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data
