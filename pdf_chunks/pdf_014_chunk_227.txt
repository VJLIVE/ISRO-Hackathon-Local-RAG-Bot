for the detection of dark dense vegetation, burned areas etc., which can be used for land use/cover dynamics related studies. Red and NIR channels are traditionally used for detecting burned areas. However, these channels are highly affected by the aerosol scattering and absorption caused by the biomass burning (Kaufman and Remer, 1994), and hence affects the values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). MIR part of the spectrum is also sensitive for the changes in the state of the vegetation (due to active chlorophyll associated with liquid water in the leaves), but it is virtually unaffected by the presence of most of the types of aerosols (except dust). Monitoring the MIR reflectance can help to study the vegetation INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 194 cover more reliably. However, MIR reflectance should be used with caution for the studies performed over global scales, only reflected component of the MIR should be utilized (Libonati et al., 2010). The emitted component of the signal may not represent the intrinsic properties of the surface. We remove the emissive component using the brightness temperature computed from the 11 µm channel of INSAT-3DR and making simple assumptions about the emissivities and transmittivity in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 µm. 16.2.2. Objective The main objective of this document is to briefly present the algorithm to generate surface reflectance (only reflective component) for the MIR band of INSAT-3DR Imager. 16.3.
