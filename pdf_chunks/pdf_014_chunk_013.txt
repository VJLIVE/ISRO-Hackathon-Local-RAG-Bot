of forward scattering increases. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 16 1.2.3. Objective The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. Daily snow and maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated. This algorithm will be further modified, with NDVI adopted from other sources and infrared brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively. 1.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 1.4.1. Overview A grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm was selected for the following reasons:  Sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS, have been used for generating the snow products using similar algorithm. (Hall et al., 1995; Kulkarni et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2013; Rathore et al., 2015).  The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and
