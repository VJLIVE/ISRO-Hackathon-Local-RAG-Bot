along with inner beam solutions for ambiguity filtering through normal filter process as shown in block diagram of figure (12). Sweet Zone Model Winds Rank of Soln True Wind Flow Outer Zone (No ranking) 1 2 3 4 Across-Track Along- Track Figure 12: Role of model winds in tagging ranks to direction solutions over outer swath 26 In this process, certain weights are assigned to wind solutions depending upon its distance from the outer edge of the swath of inner beam, otherwise, ambiguity filter process will yield wind field more resembling to the model winds loosing the impact of measurements. Further details given by Stiles et al, (2002) are being worked out. 5.2.4 Testing of algorithms with Quikscat data: The present algorithm has been tested with Quikscat data (MGDR NRT Version in BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for one orbit (#29820) on March 11, 2005, at 12.00 GMT over inner beam swath only. Based on median filter, the directional ambiguity is removed using a two-step filtering at given and coarser spatial resolutions. Quikscat data derived wind fields using NSD and MLE algorithms are depicted in figures (13a) and (13b), respectively. Figure 13: Ocean surface wind vector field derived from Quikscat radar backscatter data (NRT BUFR-25 km) over inner beam swath for March 11, 2005 over Indian region using, a) NSD algorithm, b) MLE algorithm 27 The derived winds are found to be very similar to each other as well with those of finished product winds (not depicted here). More so, the computational efficiency of the present algorithm is found to be higher (about 2 to 3 times) as compared to that of MLE algorithm during simulation studies as well as testing with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 2006). 6.0 Flagging: Retrieval of ocean surface wind vector from scatterometer
