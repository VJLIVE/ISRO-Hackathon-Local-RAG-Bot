SAPHIR and presented in Fig 10 (a). The corresponding rain from 3B42, GSMaP and 3B42-RT are shown in Fig 10 (b), (c) and (d), respectively. Over the study area, the Megha-Tropiques has an observation time of ~2050 UTC, whereas all the other products are at 2100 UTC. From these figures we can see SAPHIR picks up the intensity and pattern of rain over the cyclonic area very well, as exhibited by other rain products. When rain rates are compared qualitatively between SAPHIR and 3B42, and between SAPHIR and GSMaP, we find correlation of 0.64 and 0.70, rmse of 1.16 and 2.24 mm/h and bias of 0.12 and 0.60 mm/h, respectively. A similar comparison of rain from GSMaP and 3B42 shows a correlation of 0.72, rmse of, 2.1 mm/h and bias 0.26 mm/h. Here, it may be to note that the discrepancies between different products are possibly due to their different observation time. Nevertheless, SAPHIR rain shows a good agreement with TRMM products. The study presented herein provides a detail account of rain detection and measurement algorithm from SAPHIR. The algorithm is in two parts; the first part deals with rain identification, and the second provides the rain amount at identified pixels. The both procedures are developed separately for land and oceans and for each of the 182 10 scan positions of the SAPHIR. We have carried out extensive study to examine the worthiness of the algorithm. This is carried out first by developing a probabilistic rain identification algorithm for SAPHIR channels. We examined the effect of pixels with false rain and missing rain on rain identification. We find that their effect is limited to only very low rain regime. We further compared the rain identified by SAPHIR with TRMM-3B42 and that shows a good match at rain rates > 0.25
