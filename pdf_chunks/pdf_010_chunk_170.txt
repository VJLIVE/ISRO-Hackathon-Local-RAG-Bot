weather and climate requires a good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of smoke and its optical properties, which is only feasible by means of satellite observation. Identification of smoke on satellite Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 142 imagery is a prerequisite to study and retrieve physical, chemical, and optical properties of smoke. 9.2.2 Objective The basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying smoke using INSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time application of INSAT 3D data in the identification of smoke. 9.3 Inputs Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for Visible channel and geo-referenced Brightness temperature for MIR,TIR1, TIR2, along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). Additionally there is a requirement for dataset of forest fires acquired over India for defining thresholds. All these inputs are specifically categorized in the following subsections. 9.3.1 Static Data Radiometric and geometric corrected dataset of forest fires acquired over Indian region for the channels of corresponding INSAT-3D channels (given in table below) of MODIS sensor.
