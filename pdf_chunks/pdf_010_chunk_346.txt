17.4.2.15 Surface homogeneity test is performed. The variation of reflectance is very less over the fog region which is used as a measure to identify fog. 17.5 Outputs Generation of Fog map Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution FOG (nighttime) and FOG(Day time) Flag (0 No fog, 1 Fog) Flag (0 No fog, 1 Fog) - - - - - - Per pixel Per pixel 17.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Lat, lon, fog (in image format) Domain: 0 S to 35 N, 60 E to 100 E. Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 278 17.6 Validation 17.6.1 Data required 1. Data from different sensors required for validation Acquisition Time Sensor Product Area All Day and Night Time during the event MODIS MODIS/ INSAT3D Kalpana VHRR/ CCD data Fog Product Aerosol Optical Depth Kalpana visible data for the day time and FCC of CCD for day time Indian region Indian region Indian region 2. Fog observations from ground based network, airport and station data from IMD. 17.6.2 Methods of validation Validation through cross comparison with other satellite data/products 1. A direct comparison with the fog product of MODIS at different acquisition time over the Indian region. 2. The aerosol optical depth map generated by MODIS and INSAT-3D will be used to validate the presence of highly opaque aerosols as aerosols are also factor influencing fog formation in the Indo-Gangetic plain. 3. The Kalpana visible data and FCC of CCD data at early morning hour can also be used to indicate the presence of fog in the previous night as fog is the deepest before sunrise. Validation through ground truth As visibility is one of the important criteria for fog identification the observation from station data (where ever available) can also be used as in-situ observation to
