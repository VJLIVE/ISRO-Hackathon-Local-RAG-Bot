like India with complex atmosphere. This will improve the aerosol retrieval accuracy and will also help in establishing the fine-mode fraction as a quantitative indicator instead of the qualitative indicator for anthropogenic aerosol sources. ï‚· This product is expected to cater inputs for radiative effects of aerosols and air-quality monitoring. 9.0 Discussion In the present document, we introduced a new algorithm for deriving aerosol properties over land from OCM-2 Level 1B spectral radiance. The beta version of the OCM-2 aerosol product generated using this algorithm is operational from 17 December 2020. Unlike other algorithms, this method does not need SWIR channel observation, moreover, it does not assume near Infrared channels 27 transparent to aerosols. In fact, in addition to visible channels, it uses aerosol information contained in near Infrared channels also. The OCM-2 aerosol algorithm is tested subjectively as well as on several test datasets. The results are evaluated at co-located AERONET sites. In its provisional validation, OCM-2 AOD retrievals perform well. On average nearly 70% of AOD retrievals found within an uncertainty envelope of 20% with a correlation coefficient r = 0.83. Retrievals of fine mode fraction are found to agree with a general understanding of aerosol sources in India and to some extent have been seen correlated with an AERONET size distribution, but quantitatively have not been validated and therefore results should not be considered to be quantitative. We note that the validation of fine mode AOD will be done in near future, which will be a product that can be related to the anthropogenic contribution to the total aerosol optical depth. The provisional validation suggests that the operational beta version retrieval is capable of deriving AOD over land within expected uncertainty. However, it is necessary to perform extensive validation exercises including more ground truth sites with more
