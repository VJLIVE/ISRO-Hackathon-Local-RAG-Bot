principle, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity. For a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb and Rn is given as: Rn=(250-Tb) * (Rmax/5) -----------------(2) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 5 Rmax is again a function of PW. Rn is not allowed to exceed - corresponding Rc rain rate or 12 mm/h, whichever is lower. In H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is considered to comprising of core and non- core fractions. This is worked out by considering an area of 101X101 pixels surrounding the pixel under consideration. The minimum, mean and standard deviation of Tb (Tmin ), in this area is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual region of interest. Within this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation () of Tb are determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel is determined through the parameter Z, Z = (Tmean- Tb)/  ----------(3) The minimum and maximum allowable value of Z are 0 and 1.5. If Z < 0; H-E rain (R) = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective Otherwise, R = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3) Rc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW from NCEP NWP model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the pixel rain rate R reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if Z=0, the pixel rain rate R is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). In fact, the convective systems generally have
