by HDF5 dimension scale API for referring to in which all datasets it is being used as dimension. 2. All the Datasets in Products have and attribute named DIMENSION_LIST whose value is an array of references to the dimension scales (e.g. time, GeoY, GeoX). This attribute is maintained by the HDF5 dimension Scale API. 22 Appendix- I : INSAT-3D Radiometric Calibration COUNT TO RADIANCE INSAT-3D counts can be converted to radiance either using the lookup table (LUT) or the calibration coefficients. LOOKUP TABLE The look up table (XXX_YYYY_RADIANCE, where XXX is the sensor, YYYY is Band) provides mapping from count to corresponding radiance. A field name “Radiometric_Calibration_Type” provided as attribute of Root Group in HDF product describes source of calibration coefficients used for generating this LUT (Ref Table 2.3). CALIBRATION COEFFICIENTS Lab and Online radiometric calibration coefficients are available as part of HDF product, which can be used for computing radiance directly from count:  Lab Calibration coefficients are generated using pre-launch ground test data, where each IR detector element along with its associated processing channel is characterized in Thermo- vacuum chamber using two Blackbody targets-a Space Reference Target (SRT) simulating space and a Variable Temperature Blackbody Source (VTBS) simulating the earth scene from 180K to 340K temperature range. Using these data quadratic coefficients (slope, offset and quadratic term) for EOM 10°C, 25°C and 40°C were generated. Based on EOM temperature of an acquisition lab slope, offset and quadratic term are derived and provided in product. In HDF products a field named “invert” (provided as attribute of each channel dataset) indicates whether image counts are inverted or not. While computing the radiance values the counts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) .The lab coefficients provided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way: Count
