INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method: 1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E using Arkin’s GPI method. 2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude/longitude. 3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 images a day). 4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data. 5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc. 6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales after due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. A2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) Technique: The relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive radiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, has not yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. There are numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information at scales smaller than the existing 1.0 products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at resolutions of 1 and down to the 0.25 0) would be invaluable. There is also increasing demand from the meteorology and climate community for such products over extended periods. High-resolution rainfall information is available for limited areas using Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 48 combinations of ground-based radar and dense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, where the need of high spatial and temporal rainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of India (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan Regions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-
