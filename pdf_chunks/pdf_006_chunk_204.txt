If all spatial and temporal Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 173 neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences dif V , excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector differences   dif V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the average of 10 dif V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it goes to next previous times steps and so on. If S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different quality functions are computed as below : Direction Consistency Function: 1 ) ) / exp( tanh( 0.1 1 1 1
