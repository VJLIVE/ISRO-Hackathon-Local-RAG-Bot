These data editing criteria are valid for open ocean studies only and will be confirmed during commissioning phase. Recommendations for the use of SARAL/AltiKa data in coastal and hydrological areas may be provided to users later. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 47 4. Using the (O)(I)GDR data 4.1. Overview This section gives the reader a guide to the use of the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR data. While this handbook tries to be correct and complete, note that nothing can replace the information to be gained at conferences and other meetings from those using these data. The reader must proceed with caution and at his or her own risk. Further information is also available on the web servers provided in Annex C, please direct questions and comments to the contacts given there. The instruments on SARAL/AltiKa make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, ocean significant wave height, ocean
