Occultation geometry defining the angles used in equations 2(a, b). Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 70 At the heights of the transmitter (~ 20000 km) and receiver (low earth orbit), the indices of refraction are assumed to be equal to 1. This approximation can be shown to introduce a very small error in the estimated bending in the ionosphere and it cancels completely after doing ionospheric calibration to estimate neutral atmospheric bending. The angles t and r are determined by simultaneously solving equations 2(a) and 2(b) (easily accomplished using Newton’s method and a first guess of t=0 and r=0). The total bending angle is =t+r and the corresponding impact parameter ‘a’ is obtained by equation 2(b). If 1(a1) and 2(a2) be the bending angle as a function of the asymptotic miss distance for the L1 and L2 signals, respectively, then the linear combination ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( 0 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 0 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 0 a f f f a f f f a neut        (3), where 1 and 2 are interpolated to the same value of a0, removes first-order ionospheric bending (which is proportional to f -2). The calibration should not continue above a certain height, when the neutral atmosphere signature on the occulted signal is comparable to residual ionospheric effects or the receiver’s thermal noise. Deeper in the atmosphere, due to defocusing effects and the weakening of the signal, the L2 signal is not used when the signal to noise ratio drops below a certain limit. In that case, an extrapolation of the ionosphere correction is used from higher altitudes to correct for the ionosphere (Hocke 1997, Hocke et al., 1997). 6.2.1.2 Retrieval of refractive index profile:
