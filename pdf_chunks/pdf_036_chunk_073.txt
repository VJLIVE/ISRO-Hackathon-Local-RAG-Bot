surface height (see above), mean sea surface, geoid, tides, etc. · As stated above, the quantity to compare at each common point is : ΔSSH = Interpolated POI SSH - Interpolated POI MSS · Other geophysical corrections must be applied to ΔSSH, depending on the type of investigation The geoid model in the (O)(I)GDR could substitute the MSS model, but its use will result in reduced accuracy in the interpolation because the resolution of the geoid undulation is lower than that of the MSS. Desirable features of a fixed reference track include: · Equal spacing of points (good for FFT) · Independent variable = (point longitude - pass equator crossing longitude) · Equator is a point (simplifies calculation) · Point density similar to original data density With these specifications, it is possible to make only two fixed tracks, one ascending and one descending, which will serve for all passes. The template pass is then shifted by the equator SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 51 crossing longitude (global attribute of the product, see 6.2) of each pass. Recall that the equator longitude is from a predicted orbit (not updated during GDR processing). Improved accuracy can be obtained by interpolating in the latitude, longitude values. When one interpolates to the reference track, it is good practice to check that the interpolated latitude from the data records used is close to the latitude on the reference track. 4.2.4. Range Compression Each 1Hz frame of the AltiKa Ka band range measurement (see range parameter) is derived from the linear regression of the respective valid 40 Hz range measurements (see range_40hz parameter). An iterative outlier detection scheme is adopted in this linear regression and the resulting 40 Hz measurements are identified by setting the corresponding bit in the parameters
