The prime CNES verification site is located at Cape Senetosa on the island of Corsica (8º48' E, 41º34' N, ascending pass 85). A satellite orbit slowly decays due to air drag, and has long-period variability because of the inhomogeneous gravity field of Earth, solar radiation pressure, and smaller forces. Periodic SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 20 maneuvers are required to keep the satellite in its orbit. The frequency of maneuvers depends primarily on the solar flux as it affects the Earth's atmosphere, and there are expected to be one maneuver (or series of maneuvers) every 15 to 30 days. Each orbit maintenance maneuver is performed using only one thrust to minimize impacts on the ground orbit solution. Orbit computation is optimized to minimize the orbit error during such periods. Science data are taken during orbit maintenance maneuvers and are
