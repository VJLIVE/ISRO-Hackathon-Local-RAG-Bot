provide a practical standard for storing. 2.2. THE NETCDF DATA MODEL A NetCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which they are identified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and relations among data fields in an array-oriented data set. 2.2.1. DIMENSIONS A dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for example, time, latitude, longitude, or height. A dimension might also be used to index other quantities (waveforms index for example). The following dimensions are used in the SARAL product files: Data set Dimension name Value Reduced Standard Expertise time Number of measurements in the file Yes Yes Yes meas_ind 40 (number of elementary measurements) No Yes Yes wvf_ind 128 (number of waveform samples) No No Yes Table 2 - Dimensions used in the SARAL data sets 2.2.2. VARIABLES Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of values of the same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a data type, and a shape described by its list of dimensions specified when the variable is created. A variable may also have associated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after the variable is created. A variable data type is one of a small set of netCDF types. In this document the variable types will be represented as follows: Reference: SALP-ST-M-EA-15839-CN Version : 2.2 Date : February, 17th 2012 Page: 9/47 SALP Products Specification â€“ Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products Variable type Description char characters byte 8-bit data signed short 16-bit signed integer int 32-bit signed integer float IEEE single precision floating point (32 bits) double IEEE double precision floating point (64
