Physical basis of the SWR Algorithm The OLR-based SWR estimates have better accuracy for convective regions because the variations of surface insolation over the warm pool ocean region are primarily due to the variations in cloudiness. Variations in cloudiness are manifestation of deep convection; therefore, OLR is a good proxy for convection. Shinoda et al [1998] showed in their study that the coefficient of correlations between SWR and OLR were maximum (~0.8) at the equator that decreases as one goes away from the equator and reduces to less than 0.5 beyond 10˚N/S latitudes. Shinoda et al. [1998] proposed a simple empirical relationship (referred hereafter as SH98), valid over warm pool oceanic regions, to estimate the daily averaged SWR from the daily averaged OLR products obtained from the NOAA polar orbiting satellite. Shahi et al. [2010], proposed the use of a high temporal resolution data of OLR to improve the diurnal sampling in order to match that of the buoy SWR in computing daily averaged estimates. They demonstrated a significant improvement in the SH98 by using daytime average of OLR obtained from half-hourly geostationary satellite observations. The rationale behind using the daytime OLR as against daily (24-hr average OLR) is that the daily averaged SWR is affected solely by the presence of day-time clouds, and therefore the algorithm performs better than that used in
