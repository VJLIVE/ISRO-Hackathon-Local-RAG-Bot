used in the regression. We use 49 regression profiles (6 zenith angles upto 62.5), which cover most of profile behavior in the INSAT-3D viewing region. Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 255 All profiles should cover necessary vertical levels for temperature and absorbing gases. Among absorbing gases only water vapor and ozone are allowed to vary in mixing ratio, and other gases are held “fixed”. Fixed gases include all those whose spatial and temporal variations have a negligible impact on the observed radiances. Monochromatic layer-to-space transmittances computed for fixed and different absorbing gases at different zenith angles are convolved with the instrument SRF. For each layer the effective layer optical depths (kfixed, kwater, kozone) are obtained for fixed and variable absorbing gases. These effective layer optical depths are used in a regression analysis to compute the fast transmittance coefficients (ci). Choosing the set of predictors for accurate results is mainly a matter of trial and error. PLOD model uses 8 predictors for fixed gases (kfixed), 13 for water vapor (kwater), and 9 for ozone (kozone). These predictors are functions of temperature, water vapor, ozone profiles and sensor viewing angle, and are summarized as follows: kfixed: 1) a 2) a2 3) a.Tr 4) a.(Tr)2 5) Tr 6) (Tr)2 7) a.Tz 8) a.Tz / Tr Where, a is secant of the local path angle, Tr is the temperature ratio (Tprofile/Treference), and Tz is the pressure weighted temperature ratio above the layer: ) 5 ( )1 ( )). 1 ( ) ( ).( ( ) ( 2          l i r z i T i P i P i P l T Where P(i) is the average layer pressure for layer ‘i’. kwater: For water vapor predictors are
