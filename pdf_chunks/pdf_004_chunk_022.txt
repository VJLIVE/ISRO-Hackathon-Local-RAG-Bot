values of search intervals mentioned above are optimized based on the noise free cases considering the entire inner beam swath including nadir region. The litmus test for proper implementation of the algorithm is that the retrieval skill for the noise free cases must be 100%. The condition shown by expression (13) is effective in the situations when coarser search intervals of trial direction are used. However, the coarser δχ should be avoided due to possibility of missing proper solutions specifically over the nadir region and the retrieval becomes less computationally efficient. Moreover, δWS2 also cannot be increased in order to retain the accuracy of quadratic interpolation. The optimization of search interval, to some extent, also depends upon the intervals of wind speed and direction specified in GMF. The values of search intervals δχ and δWS1 mentioned above are optimized based on the QSCAT-1 GMF. 19 Based on simulations, primarily the evaluation of performances of the proposed algorithm in successfully retrieving the wind direction under varying noise conditions has been carried out for the inner beam data swath region including nadir region. In order to carry out simulation studies, radar backscatter data for Quikscat scatterometer observational geometry is simulated with orbital altitude of 803 km and local incidence angles of 46° and 54° at the earth’s surface with horizontal and vertical polarization, respectively. The outer beam swath is divided in a number of wind vector cells (WVC), and for each cell, azimuth angle with respect to sub-satellite track is calculated for each of the antenna beams pointing to the cell. The cells with only four beams are used for the simulation studies. At these WVC, radar backscatter data are simulated using QSCAT-1 geophysical model function (rsd@zephyr2.jpl.nasa.gov) for simulated wind vector with wind speed and direction values varied within the specifications of
