move during the next zero to three hours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 ÔÅ≠m) and visible are the principal data sets used in this diagnosis. Large scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale precipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. Satellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) estimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) estimation of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day to a month e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some statistical relationship. In case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when available to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of hydrometeors during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 mm) and 5 (12 mm). The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness temperature, and the 12-mm channel is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then subtracted from measurements of that channel to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm spectral band. In the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite sensor and surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT. The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship Although crude, the GPI method works quite well
