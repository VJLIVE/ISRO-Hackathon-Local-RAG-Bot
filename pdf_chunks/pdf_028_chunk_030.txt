SSM/I. Initially the SSM/I based coefficients will be used and later fine tuned for MADRAS, based on a large data base to be co-located during raining episodes. 2.6. Operational Implementation: At MOSDAC Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 23 2.7. Outputs: Rainfall along the sub satellite tracks. 2.7.1 Format of the output and the domain: TBD 2.8 Validation Extensive validation campaign is required during the first six months of the satellite launch. To compare retrieved rainfall totals with rainfall totals obtained by other satellites like TRMM and SSM/I will be attempted. Some more direct means, often called "Ground Truth", may also be attempted based on the avialility of well calibrated data from AWS and DWRâ€™s. The initial six months will be the calibration-validation phase with limited distribution of data. The validation is possible with: 1. Other satellite data sets from regional and global sources (land & ocean). 2. Rainfall data from well calibrated DWR data from Indian Meteorological Department The traditional approach has been to take a 2 dimensional rain field derived from radar measurements, assume it is constant in the third dimension and use the resultant pseudo 3 dimensional rain field for the simulation. This initial averaging step reduces the variability of the rain field and thereby reduces both the value and uncertainty of the BFC. 2.8.1 Data Required 2.8.2 Methods of Validation Point Measurements Micro Rain Radars Through Internet Orbital & analyzed data MADRAS/ TRMM /SSM/I Data All daily obs. sites of IMD & to plan for oceanic locations Usual point measurements over land & oceans Fast Response Rain Gauge From IMD at all DWR locations (every 1-3 hours) 0.250 x 0.250 Doppler Weather Radar Source Resolution Parameter Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 24 The level 1a and level 1b products are required for above-mentioned approaches for the rainfall retrievals.
