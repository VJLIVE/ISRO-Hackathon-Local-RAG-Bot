temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon will be carried out. This work indicated a high correlation between the fractional coverage of "cold" clouds and observed rainfall. It was determined that the highest correlation between the parameters was produced using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. An estimation method using linear regression was developed. The regression procedure yielded the simple estimation equation: R = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours] where R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of cloud-top temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period. Step: 5 Validations: Regarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR and Surface Rain Gauges (SFRG) Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly desirable in and around the maximum validation sites in temporal window of every hour. Remarks: During the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided with a flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when more than 50% of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or Monthly scale average rainfall estimates. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 174 15.4.1.2. IMSRA Technique: 15.4.1.2.1. Theoretical Background: The developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) proposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along with innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) for the estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that
