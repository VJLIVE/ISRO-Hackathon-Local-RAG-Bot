bias correction based on a polynomial model of the suitable form designed on the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). Step 6: the orographic correction is based on the climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions (Mahesh et al., 2014). Step 7: Cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Mahesh et al., 2014 and Woodley , Sancho and Vicente (1972) Step 8. Validation and fine tuning of the algorithm based on IMD’s DWR and AWS and fast response rain gauges on hourly basis. Step 9. Processing of the data for the different temporal scales (Half hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal etc.) based on the above steps of the development and validation of the algorithm. 15.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution QPE (GPI) Histogram of BT’s Daily, Weekly, Monthly & seasonal rainfall mm K mm 0 < 180 K 0 72 mm/ day > 280 K 72 mm/day TBD 24 Class TBD 1 x 1 1 x 1 1 x 1 QPE (IMSRA) ½ Hourly, 3 Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly & Seasonal rainfall mm mm 0 0 TBD TBD TBD TBD 4 km x 4 km (TIR Resol.) -- do -- INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 182 Format of the output Basic format would be to obtain QPE on a give domain with geolocation, and rainfall values. However, the QPE would be represented in various shades, contours and with desired color coding thereof. The 24 class histogram also will be generated. Domain : For both GPI and IMSRA the domain for rainfall estimation mainly would be 400 S to 400 N, 300 E to 1300 E. 15.6. Validation Rainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods mentioned above. These are required
