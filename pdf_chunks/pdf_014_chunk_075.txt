have been used for estimating incident solar radiation and surface albedo, and thermal-infrared data for estimating longwave radiation. To map the Rn, it is necessary to combine remote sensing observations with surface and atmospheric data, where the spatial variability is mainly modeled by means of albedo, emissivity, and land surface temperature maps obtained from satellite data. There are roughly two types of algorithms for estimating Rn (Liang et al., 2010), one calculates radiative quantities from the derived satellite products of all relevant atmospheric and surface variables (e.g., cloud, atmospheric temperature, LST, air and surface emissivity), and another estimates radiation directly from satellite observed radiance using a regression equation established from extensive radiative transfer simulations or using ground measurements. 5.2.2. Objectives The objectives of this document are: (iv) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of hourly (Rn) and daily net surface radiation (Rndly) over land in clear and cloudy sky (v) To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for automation of Rn and Rndly product generation (vi) To describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements amd other concurrent satellite products. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 66 5.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 5.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT- 3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the earth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55- 0.75 µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1 µm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 µm & 11.5-12.5 µm) regions. It also has 19 channel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO
