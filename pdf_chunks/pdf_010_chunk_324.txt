1988). Often it is chosen empirically (Susskind 1984; Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988). Li at al. (2000) uses discrepancy principle (Li and Huang 1999) to determine  and is changed in each iteration according to n+1 = qn.n ---------- (20) q is a factor for  increasing or decreasing. q is obtained in each iteration by the following condition: q0 = 1; if ||F(Xn) – Ym||2 < 2 then qn = 1.5 --------- (21a) if ||F(Xn) – Ym||2 > 2 then qn = 0.8 --------- (21b) Where, 2 =  ek2, ek is the observation error of channel k which includes instrument error and forward model error. The q factor is found from empirical experience to ensure Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 260 that the solution is stable from one iteration to the next. This factor would be required to tune-up carefully for the INSAT-3D Sounder channels. Since atmospheric variables correlate between different levels, only a limited number of variables are needed to explain the vertical structure of atmosphere (Smith and woolf 1976). Thus it is computationally efficient to solve the iterative equation. This reduces the number of unknown expansion coefficients to the same order as the number of measured radiances: X = fivi = V.f, i = 1, M --------- (22) Where, vi is the ith eigenvector, fi is the ith expansion coefficient, and M denotes the number of terms. V and f represent the eigenvector matrix and coefficient vector, respectively. These eigenvectors are derived from a statistical covariance matrix of a large profile set of temperature, moisture and ozone. Y = K.X = K.V.f =K ~ .f --------- (23) Corresponding iterative equation becomes, fn+1 = (K ~ n T E -1 K ~ n + nI) -1. {K ~
