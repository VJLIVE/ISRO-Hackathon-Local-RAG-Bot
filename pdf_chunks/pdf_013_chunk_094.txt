by GEWEX-SWR. For combined dataset RMSE for SAC-SWR is 27.3 W m-2, which is the smallest, followed by 32.7, 37.5 and 59.6 W m-2, respectively, for GEWEX, ISCCP and NCEP SWR products. The estimate of the standard error on weekly time scales is much smaller than that on daily time scales, with values of 11.8, 13.4, 15.3, and 32.8 Wm−2 for SAC, GEWEX, ISCCP, and NCEP products, respectively.

Operational Implementation Following steps are used to compute daily average SWR:  Half-hourly OLR data from Indian GEO Satellites is acquired for a given day.  For each observation, solar zenith is computed to ascertain the solar illumination conditions i.e. to get information about local time.  From half-hourly OLR data, the daytime averaged OLR (OLRdayavg) is computed at every pixel by restricting the solar zenith angle () to less than 80 at each pixel during averaging.  Solar zenith angle at local noon () is computed at each pixel location corresponding to the given day of observation. (In bullet 2, also solar zenith is computed)  Using land/sea flag information, the daily averaged Surface Shortwave Radiation (SWRdayavg) is computed over Indian ocean region from the empirical relationship developed at SAC: Surface Observations SWR from RAMA Buoy at 13 locations over Indian Ocean during 2002-2009 Compute half-hourly OLR following Schmetz and Liu (1988) Half-hourly OLR estimates from Indian Geostationary satellite Training Regression equation for SWR as a function of OLR and solar elevation angle SWR = cos2() [-0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) – 220.75] Compute daily average SWR Compute daytime average OLR by restricting < 80 Retrieval Satellite Observations Half-hourly IR and WV channel observations from Meteosat-5/7
