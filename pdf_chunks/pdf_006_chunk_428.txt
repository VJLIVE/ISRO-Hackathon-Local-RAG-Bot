gradation of insolation variation was seen over central India and Phailin affected eastern India in case of ‘Imager’ as compared to Kalpana-1 VHRR with 8 Km spatial resolution. The difference of mean instantaneous insolation over cloudy patches (Figure 8) in eastern India on 13 October 2013 between ‘Imager’ and VHRR is shown in Figure 8. Majority of the difference was in the range of 10 – 30 Wm-2. 20.7.3.3 Sources of uncertainties The possible sources of uncertainties that contribute to errors in K1VHRR daily insolation estimates are outlined below : Input levels (i) Inherent accuracies of products of aerosol, atmospheric water vapour (ii) Inaccuracy of cloud and fog mask (iii) Uncertainty of periodic updation of calibration coefficient of VIS band Model structure (iv) Cloud-top reflectivity is considered, no cloud absorption is considered for cloud attenuation Figure 8. Difference in mean instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) in cloudy patches on 13 October 2013 between INSAT 3D ‘Imager’ and Kalpana-1 VHRR Wm-2 Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 358 (v) Attenuation under fog is treated same as cloud over ground (vi) Diffuse insolation from cloud is not considered Ground validation (vii) Scale mismatch between estimates and measurements The insolation product will be generated at 4 km spatial scale which may not sometimes capture the sub-pixel variability of thin haze, clouds or early morning or late afternoon fog and their influence on insolation which can be captured through pyranometers at tower foot-print scale of few meters. The use of estimates averaged over 3 X 3 pixels for validation with measurements at tower foot-print scale may be valid for cloudless skies. But it may lead to underestimation if cloud patches are present and irregularly distributed in the surrounding pixels but not in the central pixel. It may lead to overestimation if cloudy patches
