can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. Mid infra-red wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 226 4. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of cloud-tracers. The comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC. 14.8 References 1.
