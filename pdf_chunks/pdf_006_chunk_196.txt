2015 168 forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. Semitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual movement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in these cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud emissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are warmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high in pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at the estimated cloud height. 2.2 Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O): Height assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of view at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud radiances.       c bcd cl P N nER N R nE N R , 1    (2) Opaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:       dp dp p T N db P N t N R P N R s c p p cl c bcd ) ( , , ,
