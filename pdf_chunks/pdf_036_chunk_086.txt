tide values provided on the GDR, load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2, provide the respective load tide values that were used to compute ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2. 5.9.2. Long period Ocean Tide The long-period ocean tides are a subject of continuing investigation. To first order, they can be approximated by an equilibrium representation. However, the true long-period ocean tide response is thought to have departures from an equilibrium response that increase with decreasing period. The two principal long-period ocean tide components, Mf and Mm, with fortnightly and monthly periods respectively, are known to have departures from an equilibrium response with magnitudes less than 1-2 cm. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR explicitly provides a value for an equilibrium representation of the long-period ocean tide that includes all long-period tidal components excluding the permanent tide (zero frequency) component (see parameter ocean_tide_equil). Note that both geocentric ocean tide values on the (O)(I)GDR (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) already include the equilibrium long-period ocean tide and should therefore not be used simultaneously. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter for a non-equilibrium representation of the long- period ocean tides (see parameter ocean_tide_non_equil). This parameter is provided as a correction to the equilibrium long-period ocean tide model so that the total non-equilibrium long period ocean tide is formed as a sum of ocean_tide_equil and ocean_tide_non_equil.

The response of the Earth is fast enough that it can be considered to be in equilibrium with the tide generating forces. Then, the surface is parallel with the equipotential surface, and the tide height is proportional to the potential. The two proportionality constants are the so-called Love numbers. It should be noted that the Love numbers are largely frequency independent,
