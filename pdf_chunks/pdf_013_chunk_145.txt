is stored. d) Steps (1-3) are offline processes. e) In online algo, pixel wise value of swir radiance , vis radiance, SZA, satzen, satazi are taken as input. Using land-sea mask, only oceanic geo-type pixels are chosen. f) A triple vector search is performed in input fields of LUT to find closest sun –satellite geometry. g) The corresponding simulated radiances in visible and swir channels is compared with observed radiance from INSAT-3D for cloudy pixels to get the best match, and corresponding values of COD and CER are assigned to that pixel.

Initial Validation The initial validation by comparing with MODIS is given in the table below Figure 2(a) INSAT-3D Cloud Effective Radius INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 127 Figure 2(b) INSAT-3D Cloud Optical Thickness 11.10. Limitations  Only daytime detection is possible.  Multi-level clouds can be a major source of error.  In case of thin clouds or highly inhomogeneous clouds , there may be inaccuracy.  Other sources of errors will include cloud water vapour absorption, inaccuracy in cloud top height assumptions, drizzle in cloud. 11.11. Future work  To test the current algorithm for 1-km resolution sector VIS-SWIR radiance product (currently not operational).  With support from IMD, NCMRWF, validation will also be carried from in-situ, aircraft campaigns and earlier campaign data from IITM. However, issues arising out of the dynamic nature of clouds and their sampling from different platforms can result in non- converging results.
