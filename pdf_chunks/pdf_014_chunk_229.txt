R can further be decomposed in the following equation (path 4 to 7 in the figure). ) 2 ( ) , ( ) cos( ) , , , ( )] , ( 1[ )] , ( 1[ ) ( ) , ( ) , (            s s s s s b sc at s E R R T B R                     εB(Ts) represents the radiance emitted by the surface due to its physical temperature (Ts), and its emissivity (intrinsic property of the surface, primarily depends on surface composition and is a gauge of the efficiency of a surface in radiating thermal energy in comparison to that of a blackbody at equivalent wavelength). ‘θ’ and ‘ϕ’ are view zenith and azimuth angles respectively. Rat↓ is the downward atmospheric thermal radiance. Rsc↓ is the downward solar diffusion radiance. (1-ε) represents the reflection. The last term of the above equation ρEτ is the direct solar radiance reflected by the surface.
