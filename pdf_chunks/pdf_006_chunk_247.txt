specific visible tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as the final height. 13.4.1.1.3 Tracking If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). It is defined as             n i t t n i s t I I I I E 1 2 1 2 1 (2) Visible wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 205 Where tI and sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is
