land, when ocean and land both considered together correlation becomes 0.84 with rmse of 0.09 mm for 327743 valid points. On the other hand, the comparison of SSMIS monthly rain with monthly rain from SAPHIR and TRMM-3B42 shows a correlation of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. Similar comparison of daily averaged rain from SAPHIR, TRMM-3B42 and SSMIS shows correlation of 0.65, 0.48 and 0.54, and rms difference of 0.31, 0.62, 0.56 mm/h, respectively. We have also tried to examine the distribution of daily averaged rain rates, for that we compared the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of daily averaged rain over tropics from SAPHIR with TRMM-3B42 for a typical month of May, 2013 (Fig. 9). The Fig. 9 shows a good agreement of the PDF of the daily averaged rain from SAPHIR and 3B42. 9 In order to show a meaningful comparison of the quality of rain estimation using SAPHIR with that from TMI and PR, we make monthly average comparison of rain over land from SAPHIR with TMI and PR in 2.5ox2.5o, and comparison with the similar statistics between PR and TMI provided by Wang et al. (2009). They have provided comparison statistics of rain derived from TMI (2A12), PR (2A25) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) (Rudolf, 1995). Based on 10 years of TRMM observations over land they have reported a correlation of 0.78 between 2A12 and 2A25 monthly mean rain rates. We have also compared SAPHIR monthly rain rates with TMI and PR for a typical month of November 2012 and found a correlation of 0.86 between SAPHIR and 2A12, and 0.68 between SAPHIR and 2A25 observations. For the same month, we find a correlation of 0.71 between 2A12 and 2A25. While comparing the statistics, it has to be borne in mind that TMI and PR have near concurrent
