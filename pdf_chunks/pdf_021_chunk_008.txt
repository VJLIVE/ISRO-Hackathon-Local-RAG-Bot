value to compute rain rate from (3). In the second step, first, the relative humidity (RH) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 6 itself from the NCEP model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then depending upon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made. 2.2 Warm-top modification The equilibrium level or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops with that of equilibrium level. This level lies below tropopause for the warm rain. In H-E method, NCEP model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine equilibrium temperature (Teq) of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels that are warmer than the equilibrium level temperature.  If the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb of the pixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows: Tb – [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less)  If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows Tb – [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) 2.3 Orographic Correction Corrections for the orography induced rain and the rain from warm clouds are also applied. This correction is carried out to ensure enhanced rain amounts along windward side and reduced rain amounts along leeward side of the mountains. The orographic correction is carried out by determining by gradient of the elevations in the direction of the prevailing 850 mb level winds (Vicente et al., 2002). 3.0 Sample Results and comparisons The H-E method which is currently operational at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) uses
