previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Again calculate wind speed and direction. Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 193 12.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution U and V component of WVWV m/sec 0 70 5 -6 m/s 0.5 – 2.5 deg Domain of output : 30oE – 130oE :: 50o S – 50o N 12.5.1 Format of the output and the domain As output of WVWV the following parameters will be provided to IMD:  Zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors.  Latitudinal and longitudinal position.  Height of WVWV The format of the final product will be like this: 12.6 Validation 12.6.1 Data required Parameter Type Source Wind Collocated Rawinsonde IMD 12.6.2 Methods of validation The evaluation of WVWV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. Quantitative assessment of the WVWV product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated Rawinsondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to the report. (i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between Rawinsondes and satellite winds for low (>700 hPa),
