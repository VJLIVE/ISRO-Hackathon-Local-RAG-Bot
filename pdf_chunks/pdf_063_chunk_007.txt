defined in Table 5 below. Any value out of this range is clipped (to lower or upper bound of range) appropriately. The image pixels are coded as unsigned short integer using slope and offset. The slope and offset are mentioned in the corresponding xml file. The BT value can be obtained from unsigned short integer value as shown by equation 1. The sigma0 or gamma0 value can be obtained from unsigned integer value as shown by equations 2 to 7. Basically, LSB of sigma0 or gamma0 product carries the sign of parameter in linear scale. Rest of the bits carry sigma0/gamma0 value in dB. For BT: BT_value_in_degK = unsigned_short_int_value*slope + offset (1) For sigma0 and gamma0: intermediate_value = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0xFFFE) (2) sign_bit = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0x0001) (3) para_value_in_dB = intermediate_value*slope + offset (4) sign_value = -1 if sign_bit = 1 (5) sign_value = 1 if sign_bit = 0 (6) para_value_in_linear_scale = sign_value*10.0^(para_value_in_dB/10.0) (7) The absence of parameter is denoted by coded value of 65535. So, value of parameter should be computed only if coded value is not equal to 65535.

K Gamma0 0.001 -50.0 -50.0 15.0 dB 3.0 File Naming Convention The naming convention is designed to convey necessary information about the product. The products formed using multiple days of data has start day as well as end day information. The products generated using single day of data has the corresponding day in the file name. The file name also conveys parameter, category and sub-category of the product. The convention is described below:  For NorthPolar24 and SouthPolar24 products: S1L4PL_yyyyddd_AAA_CC_V_R.tif  For India, NorthPolar72, SouthPolar72 and Global products: S1L4PL_yyyyddd_yyyyddd _AAA_CC_V_R.tif where
