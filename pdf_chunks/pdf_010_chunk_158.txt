P. Singh, Bipasha Paul Shukla Fire Identification Baseline Document 8.2 Introduction In this document, we offer some background to the fire identification problem, list the INSAT-3D instrument characteristics, describe the theoretical basis of the fire identification algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm implementation, and outline the planned validation approach, the technical issues and the future scope. 8.2.1 Overview and background Forest fire management in tropical countries is one of the major issues. Forest fire quite frequently occurs during summer seasons in tropical countries. A study by forest survey of India has revealed that 51% of the forest area in Assam and Gujarat, 93% in Arunachal Pradesh, 67% in Bihar, 69% in Himanchal Pradesh, 46 % in Jammu and Kashmir, 45% in Karnataka, 76% in Madhya Pradesh, 94% in Meghalaya and Orissa, 87% in Nagaland, 58% in Uttar Pradesh and 33% in W. Bengal is subject to annual
