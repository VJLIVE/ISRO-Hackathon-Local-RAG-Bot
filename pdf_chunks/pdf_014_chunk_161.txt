The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. Quantities AN, BN, CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is given as INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 142 QI = 0.4 PCF VCF SCF DCF    All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. The constant quantities AN, BN, CN, and DN are chosen as: Direction consistency A1 50 Vector consistency A3 0.8 B1 15 B3 0.01 C1 15 C3 1.0 D1 8 D3 5.0 Speed consistency A2 0.5 Spatial consistency A4 0.2 B2 0.01 B4 0.01 C2 2.0 C4 1.5 D2 0.7 D4 0.75 In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets (i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”. Hundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional flow
