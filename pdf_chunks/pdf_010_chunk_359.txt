(2) Atmospheric column water vapour: The water vapour values ranging from 0.1 g/cm2 to near saturated level have been used through each atmospheric profile. (3) Surface temperature: The land surface temperature ranging from 260-330 K has been taken keeping tropical region as the context. (4) View zenith angle (VZA): 0 to 60 degree. (5) Land surface emissivity: Emissivity values from the standard International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover types, major 10 major land cover types (ocean water, snow, sand, crop, shrubs, grass, forest,
