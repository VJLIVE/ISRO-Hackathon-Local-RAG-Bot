in regions where diurnal cycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous measurements of rainfall from microwave sensors are more accurate and thus are useful in calibrating other sensors like visible and IR. At present, the algorithms for the quantitative estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are quite successful but suffer from a scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. Theoretical and empirical studies addressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical assessment continues to appear. A definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because of the complex and variable microphysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis-Ã -vis coarser resolution of microwave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the rainfall data from the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several algorithms have been developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall used here is based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width of about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by NASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is most plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation of rain estimates from IR measurements. Following the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, IMSRA is thus proposed in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. However our recent sensitivity study has suggested that the environmental correction factor (PWRH) is more suitable for larger scale rainfall (such as in GPI within 10 x10) than for (IMSRA within or less than 0.10x0.10). This factor
