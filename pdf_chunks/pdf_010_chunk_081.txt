Varma R M Gairola QPE from HE Baseline Document 4.2 Introduction Rainfall affects the lives and economies of a majority of the Earth's population. Rain systems, such as hurricanes, typhoons, monsoons, and fronts are crucial to sustaining the livelihood of many countries. Excess rainfall can cause flood, property and crop damages. A deficiency causes drought and crop failure. Flood is a disaster that often resulted from intense precipitation in short time. Floods are among the most devastating national hazards in the world, claiming more lives
