basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995; Vicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and Gutman 1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; Vicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the following steps which are heavily drawn from (Ba, M., and A. Gruber, 2001). Step 1. Screening Method: One of the most important aspects in estimating rainfall using IR measurements is to distinguish nonprecipitating cirrus from active cold convective clouds. To remove cirrus clouds, an empirical procedure developed by Adler and Negri (1988) was adapted in NOAA/NESDIS for areas smaller than originally applied. A slope (S) and a temperature gradient (G,) are computed for each local temperature minimum in a window of 25 GOES pixels [note that Adler and Negri (1988) searched an entire cloud area for points colder than their neighbors]. The terms G, and S are given by Eq. (I) and Eq. (2), respectively: Gt = Tavg -Tmin and (1) S = 0.568 (Tmin -217) (2) where T min is the local minimum in the window of 25 X 25 pixels, and as in Adler and Negri (1988), Tavg is the mean temperature of the 6 pixels surrounding the current pixel (4 pixels along the scan and 2 pixels across the scan because the pixel offset along the scan is Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 57 approximately one-half as large as across the scan). Based on G and S the decision is made about the cirrus delineation. There are many channels needed for this screening procedure and has been originally developed only for mid latitudes, we are aware of a more recent cloud classification approach by CNES as an alternative (Roca
