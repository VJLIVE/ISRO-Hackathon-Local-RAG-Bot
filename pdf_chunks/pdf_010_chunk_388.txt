The local intensity of radiation is dependent on angle between the direction of Sun's rays and the normal to atmosphere. This angle will change within a day and with latitude on different days of the year. Solar radiation received at the top of the earth's atmosphere on a horizontal surface is called extraterrestrial (solar) radiation, a R . It is computed using astronomical units as listed by Iqbal (1983).         s S r SC a d G R        sin cos cos sin sin ) 60 ( 24   a R = Extra-terrestrial radiation [MJm-2day-1] SC G = Solar constant (0.82 MJm-2min-1) rd = inverse of relative distance between earth and sun S = Sunset hour angle (radian)  = Latitude (radian) = Solar declination (radian) 19.4.6 Solar or shortwave radiation   s R The radiation penetrates the atmosphere, some of the radiation is scattered, reflected or absorbed by the atmospheric gases, cloud and dust. The amount of solar radiation reaching horizontal plane is known as the incident solar radiation at surface Rs. The Rs should be in MJm-2day-1. 19.4.7 Net solar or net shortwave radiation   ns R The net shortwave radiation is net balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation in short wave range and
