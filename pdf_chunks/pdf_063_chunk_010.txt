of the product. The start and end orbit number conveys the start and end revolution number used for product generation. 9 The NUM_REV entry indicates actual number of revolutions available for generation for product. Similar information is conveyed in the quality parameter. The QC will have value of 0/1/2 depending on quality being poor/partially good/good respectively. The DATA_SCALE and DATA_OFFSET indicate the scale and offset values (as specified in section 2) used for generating particular product. 5.0 Visualization through browse products The browse products are generated for each tif product. These jpg images are intended to help user visualize the quality of product before using it. The range chosen for browse product is subset of range specified by section 2. The browse product range has been reduced for better visualization.

The Data Product Generation System is installed at MOSDAC. The DPGS regularly fetches L1B products and invokes product generation software for all kinds of Level 4 products. After generation of products, the DPGS uploads product files on MOSDAC site. The products are disseminated from the MOSDAC site (www.mosdac.gov.in). Along with the products in GeoTIFF format, browse jpeg images and xml metadata files are made available to the users. The users can search the products based on information in xml files and view the product using browse images. 7.0 Abbreviations NSIDC National Snow and Ice Data Centre EPSG European Petroleum Survey Group MOSDAC Meteorological & Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre xml Extensible Markup
