is effectively an rms error in a dual band algorithm of 0.14K, assuming perfect atmospheric correction. Therefore, we have requested that the calibration be demonstrably accurate at the choice of 0.05K level to minimize the effect of calibration errors. The best atmospheric correction currently available for ATSR suggests that errors due to atmospheric correction in optimal cases for a nadir viewing instrument are approximately 0.3K [Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1990; Barton, et al., 1993; Minnett, 1995b]. If one assumes that the calibration errors and the atmospheric errors are random and thus can be RSSâ€™d, as in the preceding analysis, one sees that expected errors of 0.35K-0.4K in the result are the best that can be expected for two-band configurations. This equation also points out that there is a cost associated with adding more bands to improve atmospheric correction. In addition to providing information potentially useful for correcting the effects of the intervening atmosphere, each additional band also introduces noise into the SST retrieval.
