field named “invert” (provided as attribute of each channel dataset) indicates whether image counts are inverted or not. While computing the radiance values the counts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) .The lab coefficients provided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way: Count = DNMax- Count (only if invert = True) Where DNMax 1023 for Imager and DNMax = 16383 for Sounder R (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1) = lab_radiance_quad*(Count)2 + lab_radiance_scale_factor*(Count) + lab_radiance_add_offset  Online calibration is performed using onboard internal blackbody serving as a "hot target" and space view count as "cold target". From these two online slope and offset are computed. Quadratic term is derived using inter sensor calibration. 23 In HDF products a field named invert indicates inversion of image counts. While computing the radiance values the counts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) . The online coefficients provided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way: Count = DNMax- Count (only if invert == true) Where DNMax 1023 for Imager and DNMax = 16383 for Sounder R (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1)=online_radiance_quad *(Count)2 + online_radiance_scale_factor*(Count)+online_radiance_add_offset COUNT TO BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE Count can be converted to Brightness Temperature (BT) using 2 methods:  Using LUT provided in the product (XXXX_YYY_TEMP, where XXXX is Sensor YYY is Band).  First convert count to radiance as discussed above and then generate BT from radiance using inverse planck's law as given below. brightness_temperature = C2 / (cwl * log(C1 / (1.0E6 * rad_w_m2 * pow (cwn, 5.0)) + 1)) Where cwl(metres)= central_wavelength(um)/1000000.0 (Field central_wavelength in product) rad_w_m2 = radiance*10.0 (For converting from mw cm-2 sr -1 um-1 to w m-2 sr-1 um-1) h = 6.6260755e-34 kg m2 s-1; c = 2.9979246e+8 ms-1; k = 1.380658e-23 kg m2
