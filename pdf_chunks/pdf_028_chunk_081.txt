ionospheric terms. Therefore, measurement of n directly corresponds to electron density in the ionosphere. In the neutral atmosphere (tangent point height < 60 km), the ionospheric calibration process effectively removes the first order ionosphere term (1/f2) in (7). In order to solve for P, T and/or e, given N, one has to use additional constraints of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law:  g dh dP   (8) TR e m m TR P m d w d w d ) (         (9) Where, h is height; g is the acceleration due to gravity; , d, w total, dry air and water vapor densities respectively; md, mw the mean molecular mass of dry air (28.97 g/mole) and water vapor (18.0 g/mole), respectively; R is the universal gas constant. Combining (8) and (9) and, using (7) (ignoring ionospheric, ice and liquid water terms) to substitute for P/T, we obtain T e R m m g T e R a gm a N R a gm dh dP w d d d ) ( 1 2 1 2      (10) Given N, we have a system of two equations ((7) and (10)) and three unknowns (T, P, and e). Since saturation vapor pressure decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature, e can be ignored above the tropospheric height corresponding to 230 K; therefore given N, both T and P can be solved for in the upper troposphere and stratosphere from (7) and (10) and a boundary condition (usually taken to be a temperature boundary condition at ~60 km estimated from a climatology or an atmospheric model). What we get are the “dry” temperature and pressure, accurate to real temperature and pressure in the water vapor scarce Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0
