for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55- 0.75 µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1 µm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 µm & 11.5-12.5 µm) regions. It also has 19 channel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The spatial resolution of VIS band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for WV and thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides (Bhattacharya et al. 2013) both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an- hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3DR data products scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 columns for Asia Mercator sector product. 5.2.3.2 Operational surface insolation product A spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3DR will be used to provide minimum ground brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme will be implemented to obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout the day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm has been operationalized (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b)
