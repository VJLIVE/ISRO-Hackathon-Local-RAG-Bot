also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based observation network often fail to work. In view of the limitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large area is by using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer frequent uniform coverage over large area. However, the satellite measurements also suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR methods suffer from their inability to sense hydrometeors directly (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), microwave measurements suffer due to their coarser spatial and temporal resolution, rain variability within their large footprint referred as beam filling problem, uncertainty in the drop-size distribution, drop temperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops etc. (Varma et al, 2003, Varma and Liu, 2006, Varma and Liu, 2010, and Varma and Pal, 2012). Due to inherent inability of IR measurements to directly sense the hydrometeors, the rain retrieval using them is always indirect in nature. In the past, there are a number of methods developed for rain estimation (barrett and Martin, 1981); they range from very simple algorithms in which brightness temperature (Tb) is directly related to rain rate (e.g., Arkin et al., 1989) to those which involved complex hypothetical models (e.g., Scofield, 1987). Scofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense precipitation over a storm. His method called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) that used half-hourly satellite images to measure the precipitation over the active area of a storm. His technique involved the skill of a trained meteorologist to find out active portion of a storm. He also utilized the total atmospheric precipitable water (TPW) and water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for dry/wet environment and equilibrium level adjustments for rain that comes from
