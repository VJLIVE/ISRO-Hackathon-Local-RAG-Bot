the atmosphere towards the satellite as calculated by radiative transfer model. The transfer calculations are performed for a set of different constant humidity values for the upper tropospheric atmosphere for standard atmosphere representing different months/seasons. Empirical coefficients generated for different months are then used to derive from the IR and WV radiation measured by the satellite to estimate an average of the upper tropospheric humidity that caused the emitted radiation to be attenuated to the values measured. Only the pixels of surface and low cloud clusters are used, excluding the pixels of contamination with medium and high cloud clusters from the processing. 15.2.2 Objective Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 232 In this project the algorithm will be developed for computing Upper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) from WV channels 6.7 m of VHRR onboard Kalpana –1, INSAT-3A and Imager onboard future INSAT-3D satellite. 15.3 Inputs 15.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Atmospheric profile (2311) of Temperature, Water Vapour, Ozone - - TIGR-3 data base (Chevallier, Che´din, Che´ruy, & Morcrette, 2000) 41 diverse profiles of temperature, water vapour, Ozone - - ECMWF SeeBor dataset of diverse profiles (~12000) - - Seeman and Borbas, CIMSS/SSEC 15.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of WV channel#2 (5.7- 7.1) of INSAT- 3A/Kalpana and Channel#4 (6.5-7.1) of INSAT-3D Imager Pixel 10bit - Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR channel#3 (10.5- 12.5) for INSAT- 3A/Kalpana and Imager Channel#5 (10.2-11.3) for INSAT-3D pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Coefficients for conversion of Gray value to radiances - - - Derived by DP Geolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP 15.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D
