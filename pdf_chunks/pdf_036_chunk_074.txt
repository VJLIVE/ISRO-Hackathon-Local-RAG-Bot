band range measurement (see range parameter) is derived from the linear regression of the respective valid 40 Hz range measurements (see range_40hz parameter). An iterative outlier detection scheme is adopted in this linear regression and the resulting 40 Hz measurements are identified by setting the corresponding bit in the parameters (range_used_40hz) to 1. Measurements not considered as outliers have the parameters (range_used_40hz) set to 0. The number of valid 40 Hz measurements that are used to derive each of the 1 Hz measurements is provided on the (O)(I)GDRs (see range_numval parameter), as are the root-mean-square of the differences between the valid 40 Hz measurements and the derived 1 Hz measurement (see range_rms parameter). Specialized applications, such as over land, ice, lakes or rivers, may require that the users perform their own compression algorithm on the 40 Hz measurements. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 52 5. Altimetric data This section presents a short discussion of the main quantities on the (O)(I)GDR. An excellent overview of the theoretical and practical effects of radar altimetry is the “Satellite Altimetry” Chapter by Chelton et al [2001]. 5.1. Precise Orbits CNES has the responsibility for producing the orbit ephemeris for the SARAL/AltiKa data products. The SARAL/AltiKa OGDRs provide a navigator orbit that has radial accuracies better than 30 cm (rms), the IGDRs provide a preliminary orbit that has radial accuracies better than 4 cm (rms), while the GDRs provide a precise orbit that has radial accuracies better than 3 cm (rms). 5.2. Altimeter Range An altimeter operates by sending out a short pulse of radiation and measuring the time required for the pulse to return from the sea surface. This measurement, called the altimeter range, gives the distance between the instrument and the sea surface, provided that the velocity
