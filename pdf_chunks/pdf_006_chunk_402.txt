The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured ETo gradually increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from daily to 7-day i.e from 8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah (BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer (6.3%) as compared to LPSC (Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. Similarly per cent deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the deviation drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day except than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days as marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from daily to 7-days and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help us use this ETo data in various applications on different time scales with known errors. Figure 9. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation 19.7.1.4 Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere Considering the results of Penmanâ€“Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial ETo as no regular spatial record are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) attempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o x 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS operational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast retrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the
