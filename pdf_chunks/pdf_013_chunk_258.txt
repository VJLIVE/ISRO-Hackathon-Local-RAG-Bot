resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ETo mean value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational product of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05Â°grid for estimation of ETo at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from measured mean) but it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and further in monthly scale (21% from monthly mean). The overall error at different temporal domain were found in good harmony with reported errors in other part of world. 17.8. Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues The following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of ETo estimates and its comparison with ground reference (i) Influence of vegetation in AMS The FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and radiation data from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct measurement of radiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in terms of standard energy units. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The sensitivity analysis of P-M method by Gong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) highlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were clearly the most influent variables for ETo estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data from AMS are used. But these measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. Since vegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS would definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates from integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables. (ii) Scale mismatch Spatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel area while
