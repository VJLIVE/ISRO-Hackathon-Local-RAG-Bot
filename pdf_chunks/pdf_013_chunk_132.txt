µm or CO2 absorption channel in 15 µm band) and channels with less absorption. In general, the brightness temperatures in strong absorption channels are much cooler than the brightness temperatures (BT) in weak absorption channels for clear atmospheric condition or low level clouds. Contrary to this, for high level clouds BT in strong absorption channel is warmer than the weak absorption channels (Soden and Bretherton, 1993; Schmetz et al., 1997). Appropriate thresholds were taken to identify the high level clouds in INSAT-3D/3DR cloud top retrieval algorithm. In present algorithm 14.03 µm (channel 3) and 13.33 µm (channel 5) of INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are used for this purpose. If BT of ch#3 is greater than the BT of ch#5 by a given threshold, then the cloud is assumed to be high cloud and cloud top pressure from CO2 slicing method is retained. Equation (8) is used to retrieve cloud top pressure for a 5 x 5 FOR. The left side of Equation (8) contains the terms for observed radiances as well as clear radiances. The value of observed radiances is calculated by taking the average of cloudy pixels within 5x5 FOR. Cloud top computation is carried out only if 16 or more cloudy pixels are found within 5x5 box. Computation of clear sky radiances and transmittances is carried out using a fast forward radiative transfer model called RTTOV (Eyre 1991; Saunders et al. 1999; Matricardi et al 2001) developed at European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). RTTOV uses the Pressure Layer Optical Depth algorithm (Hannon et al 1996). This model is very flexible and can take any number of pressure levels for forward model computation, however, internally it interpolates atmospheric profiles to fixed 43 pressure levels ranging from 1013 to 0.1 hPa. This interpolation is done because fast forward coefficients
