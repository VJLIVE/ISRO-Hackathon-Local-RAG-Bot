The vector θ = [chl, acdm(λ), bbp(λ)] represents variables to be retrieved, whereas φ = [a∗ph(λ1)..a∗ph(λN ), S, η] is the vector of modeled parameters. Maritorena et al. 2002 solved the bio- optical model [known as Garver–Seigel–Maritorena (GSM) algorithm] by minimizing the cost function described in (7). The model parameter vector (φ) was optimized from global data set using simulated annealing technique. The value of vector φ in the GSM algorithm is kept constant throughout the scene which may create a strong bias while solving for the unknown vector (θ), especially in optically complex waters. Likewise, Lee et al. [18] proposed quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) for deriving IOPs from Rrs in which he used empirical relations for estimating the parameters S and η [see (8) and (9). Limitation of QAA algorithm is with the parameterization of CDM slope S [see (8)]. The equation for S makes sense as it exploits the Rrs explicitly, but is not sufficient to deal with all kinds of waters, thus affecting the retrieval outcome. In case of optically complex waters, S takes much lower value for waters with high CDOM absorption at 443 nm. In addition, the presence of other constituents may change the slope value significantly 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡= 1 (𝑁𝜆−1) ∑ [𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆𝑖, 𝜃, 𝜓) −𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆𝑖)]2 𝑁𝜆 𝑖=1 (7) 𝑆= 0.015 + 0.002 0.6+rrs(443) rrs(555) (8) ƞ = 2.2 * (1.0 - 1.2 * exp(-0.9 * (rrs[440] / rrs[555]))) (9) where rrs is the remote sensing reflectance just below the water surface and is related to Rrs by the following equation: rrs()
