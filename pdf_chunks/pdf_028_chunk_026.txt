a similar scattering signature, a set of "screens" would be developed to remove such features based on the screening approach of Ferraro et al. 1996. . The desert check involves the use of polarization information at 19 GHz, while the separation of rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving the Tb at 22 and 85 GHz. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 21 Specifically, the following type of relationship would be attempted based on PR rain rate and SSM/I based SIO to work best for tropical Indian Ocean and global oceanic regions. RR mm/hr . = a SIOï€ b This method to retrieve rain rate would be compared with the standard products of rainfall from SSM/I and TRMM. TRMM provides various data sets on rain rates over both land and oceans in the form of surface rain rate, total rain in 3 hourly etc. Similarly SSM/I provides oceanic rain rates on instantaneous and accumulation on daily basis. 2.5.6. Instantaneous Land Rainfall Over land, rainfall retrievals are far more complex and difficult than oceanic retrievals due to the large and variable emissivity of the land surface. Specifically, the high emissivity masks the emission signature that is related directly to the water content in the atmosphere. Instead, only the brightness temperature depression due to scattering in the upper portion of clouds is observed. The scattering, as shown in Figure 3, increases with increasing frequencies. Consequently, brightness temperature depressions at the 89 GHz channel of MADRAS will contain the least ambiguous signal of scattering by ice and/or large raindrops. The brightness temperature depression will be converted to an expected rainfall rate through the retrieval scheme where databases of hydrometeor profiles (associated with a variety of rain systems) will be developed for different climatological zones. Recent results from TRMM indicate that the relationship of lightning flashes (which
