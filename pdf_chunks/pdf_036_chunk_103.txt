Software provided with netCDF : “ncdump” « ncdump » converts netCDF files to ASCII form (CDL) See http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/ncdump-man-1.html The main options are the following : -h Show only the header information in the output, that is the declarations of dimensions, variables, and attributes but no data values for any variables -c Show the values of coordinate variables (variables that are also dimensions) as well as the declarations of all dimensions, variables, and attribute values -v var1,...,varn The output will include data values for the specified variables, in
