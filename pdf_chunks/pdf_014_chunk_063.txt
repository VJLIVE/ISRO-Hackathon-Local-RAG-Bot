the 30-day composite value of surface emissivity for cloudy pixel from from historical MODIS data or sliding monthly NDVI composite will be used. If the LST is recovered then by using equation 2, we can obtain latent heat flux under cloudy conditions. (LEcld) In this case also, like clear sky conditions for solving ɸ (Rn –G) as mentioned in equation (2) & (6) we need to obtain soil heat flux. If LST is recovered under cloudy sky conditions the soil heat flux can be obtained by using TI- based model as discussed above. Here, in case of cloudy conditions for vegetation fraction (fc) we will use sliding monthly NDVI composite value cloudy pixel from external sources. By using equations 7-10 soil heat flux (G) will be computed. Once ‘G’ is obtained using method mentioned in figure (3) cloudy sky Latent heat flux (λE cld) 4.5.1. Daily Evapotranspiration (ET) The hourly latent heat flux (W m-2) will be converted in hourly ET (mm) using expression : λE (mm depth of water per hour ) = (λE (Wm-2) * 0.0015) (12) This hourly ET will be summed to obtained daily and day time evapotranspiration in mm depth of water loss per day. 4.5.2. AET anomaly The Agro-Met Field Units (AMFUs) also require anomaly of AET products from mean for Friday- Monday and Tuesday –Thursday of each week. Once the algorithm is tested, validated and INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 55 integrated into MMDRPS and declared operational, the algorithm will be for processing of past years INSAT 3D and ancillary data to generate long term daily, time-binned AET, mean and percent anomaly from mean. 4.5.3. Steps for operational implementation The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of evapotranspiration over land (AET) product generation: i) Three-hourly temperature data at 2-meter
