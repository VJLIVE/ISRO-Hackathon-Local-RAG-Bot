method along with the known emissivity values generated over India with the help of approximately 20 emissivity tiles of MODIS. The LST products have been generated with a typical spatial resolution of 4 km. A specific land-sea mask was applied to obtain only the landmass covered within the image. The cloudy pixels in the LST products are not masked out in the initial stage. The cloud masking was done in later part of the analysis based upon a bi-spectral thresholding method and an example of such LST image is shown in figure 11. To demonstrate the applicability of our SW method, all 40 images were converted to the LST and for detailed analysis and validation, three images were selected corresponding to daytime (05:30 and 09:00 GMT) and night time (21:00 GMT) of 29th Nov. 2013 over India.

Examples of the 3D-LST images are shown in the figure 12 for diurnal images acquired on Nov. 29, 2013. The 3D-LST images suggest that LST values
