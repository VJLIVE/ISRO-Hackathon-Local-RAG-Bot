set. Based on bathymetric information, all optical data corresponding to locations falling within 50-m depth zone, classically defined as case-2 waters, were extracted from NOMAD. The data points from NOMAD were filtered on the basis of finite values of available optical parameters like water leaving radiance (Lw), surface solar irradiance (Es) etc., with ag available at minimum five wavelengths. Two channels for ag are sufficient to estimate CDOM slope S using [20, eq. (13)]; however, more optical bands were added to make the filtration process robust in order to reduce the data redundancy while retaining its variability. Bio-optical data corresponding to Indian coastal waters collected under various in situ campaigns were also merged with NOMAD and the combined data set with 161 measurements were utilized for model development. Fig. 4 shows the approximate locations of these data points. Slope of CDOM (S) was found to be highly variable ranging from 0.007 to 0.05 nm−1 for the values of reference absorption ag (443) ranging from 0.015 to 0.6 m−1. To account for this variability, a power fit was performed as shown in equation (14). Fig. 4. Set of data points taken from NOMAD and Indian coastal waters. 4.4 Discussion and Validation on ABOM Water samples from 64 stations were collected during 2014 and 2015 in Chilika lagoon (sampling locations shown in Fig. 1) and in situ chl-a were estimated using spectrophotometer. Comparison of chlorophyll–a concentration derived using Lee–Morel [8], [21], GSM [7], and ABOM model (this letter) in optically complex waters of Chilika Lagoon (see Fig. 5) indicate significant differences among the SA models when compared with in situ measurements. The mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of pooled data set for Lee–Morel and GSM was above 150% while ABOM showed significant improvement in reducing the MAPD to 58%. From Table I,
