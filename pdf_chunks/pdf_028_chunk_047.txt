temperature measurements are the system noise at antenna and radiometer system, calibration, uncertainties in knowing the actual measurement geometry (viz. incidence angle and polarization etc). Thus knowledge of total error in measurements is must for establishing the retrieval matrix which enables to provide better estimates of geophysical parameters with known errors as far as possible. The point to be noted here is that the retrieval will have errors in geophysical estimates from the erroneous data; however, the errors will be still more if we underestimate the overall error in brightness temperature and use such retrieval matrix D with actual data having even higher errors. On the other hand, the errors will also be more in parameters retrieved with matrix D established using overestimated errors and using it with less erroneous data. Therefore, it is must to know the true behavior of radiometer, system in terms of total error in brightness temperatures and the biases in the measurements. The next step is to fine-tune the retrieval matrix using the insitu data widely spread over space and time. Moreover, the theoretical errors (mostly of non-random nature) due to radiative transfer model are taken care by fine tuning of retrieval matrix through validation data. General Form of Retrieval Algorithms for MADRAS The MADRAS retrieval algorithms for various geophysical parameters would have the following general form:        N i i i o Tb f c c G 1 where, G = Desired geophysical parameter (WS, IWV, CLW), and co & ci = retrieval coefficients for parameter G for ith channel Post-Launch Scenario After MT-MADRAS is launched and the collocated in situ data are available, we will calibrate the pre-launch algorithm by making small adjustments to the coefficients of the retrieval algorithms presented in section 3.5. This will be
