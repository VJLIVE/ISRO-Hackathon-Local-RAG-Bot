Singh Snow Cover Mapping EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Algorithms will be developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D Meteorological payload. The snow mapping algorithm will use a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel- by-pixel basis, and to map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow mapping, as it reflects strongly in the visible region than in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of the spectrum. In addition, the reflectance of clouds remains high in the short-wave IR, while the reflectance of snow is considerably low. Validation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data of Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS snow maps. The accuracy of the snow maps will vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snowmap algorithm has been and will continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error
