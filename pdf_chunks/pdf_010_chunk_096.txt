[(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) (c) Orography and Parallax correction Orography adjustment is carried out using 850 â€“hPa Winds and topography from a digital elevation model at 4 km resolution to derive vertical component of wind (Vicente et al., 2002). This vertical wind component is then scaled into a multiplicative adjustment to the rain rate. The parallax correction described in the same paper, adjusts the horizontal location of the satellite pixel prior to rain rate computation, based on cloud height (using Tb and standard atmosphere) and satellite zenith angle. Satellite Zenith angle correction is carried out to take into accounts the increased path length at higher angles. A technique developed by Joyce et al. (2001) is used.

The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly basis and compared with rain values provided by IMD in Weakly Weather Report (WWR). A scatter plot of comparison is shown in Fig. 3 below. The Fig. 3 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the week-by- week comparison statistics is provided in Table 1.6.1 below. Fig. 3: Comparison
