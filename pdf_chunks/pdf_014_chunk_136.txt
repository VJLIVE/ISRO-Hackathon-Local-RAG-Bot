Radiance bias adjustment is carried out by previous eight days of good quality matchup data of INSAT-3D/3DR sounder clear-sky sounder observations and spatially and temporally collocated simulated INSAT-3D/3DR sounder radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS analysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky observations are average over 5x5 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% pixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In addition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less than 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment factor in terms of slope and offset. References Ackerman, S. A., and S. K.
