VIS channel of INSAT-3D/3DR Spatial: 120km x 120km Temporal: 30 Minutes 2.5 to 3 m/s (in low-levels) AMV retrieved from MIR channel of INSAT-3D/3DR Spatial: 120km x 120km Temporal: 30 Minutes 3 to 4 m/s (in low-levels) 12.6. Algorithm Functional Specifications 12.6.1. Methodology To compute 5-day composite of AMV maps for three broad atmospheric levels (high, mid and low- levels), retrieved scattered AMVs, available at 30-minutes interval, are gridded into 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree horizontal resolution covering the ares 0E-130E, 50S-50N and by taking 50 hPa vertical difference. The vertical pressure levels considered in this case are: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 hPa respectively. Where-ever AMV is not available an undefined value of -999 are assigned to the grid point. Once gridded AMV at every 30-minute interval is generated, 5-day composite maps are generated by taking average of all available AMVs for a particular grid point. i) High-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 100 hPa to 400 hPa are averaged for 5-Day to generate 5-Day composite High-level Map. ii) Mid-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 401 hPa to 700 hPa are averaged for 5-Day to generate 5-Day composite mid-level Map. iii) Low-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 701 hPa to 950 hPa are averaged for 5-Day to generated 5-Day composite low-level Map 12.6.2. Operational Implementation Step 1: Extracting 30-minute AMVs from HDF5 file for current acquision time. Step 2: 30-minutes AMV are gridded into 05 x 05 degree horizontal resolution and 18 vertical levels.
