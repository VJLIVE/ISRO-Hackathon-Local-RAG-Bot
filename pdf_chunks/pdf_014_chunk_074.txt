(2009) and Westerhoff (2015) were observed sensitivity of Rn from 10 to 40% for ET over different agro-ecosystems. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 65 5.2.1. Overview and background Rn is the difference between the incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes at the surface. Mathematically described as: nl ns n R R R   (a) si so si ns R R R R ) 1(      (b) lo li nl R R R   (c) where Rsi is the incoming shortwave radiation (Wm−2), Rso is the reflected outgoing shortwave radiation (Wm−2), which is calculated by Rso = α × Rsi, α is the shortwave broadband albedo (dimensionless), thus Rns is the net shortwave radiation, Rli is the incoming longwave radiation (Wm−2), Rlo is the outgoing longwave radiation (Wm−2), and Rnl is the net longwave radiation (Wm−2). Rn is normally positive during the daytime because net shortwave radiation dominates, but negative during the nighttime because net longwave radiation dominates (Allen et al., 1998). If all four components of Eq. (a) are known, the calculation of Rn is straightforward. Indeed, many radiation measurement towers measure these four components of radiation, thereby allowing us to determine Rn a given instance and location. Various satellite observations have been used to generate radiation products at regional and global scales (Liang et al., 2010, 2013b; Zhang et al., 2014). MeteoSat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG SEVIRI) Satellite observations from the visible to near-infrared spectrum have been used for estimating incident solar radiation and surface albedo, and thermal-infrared data for estimating longwave radiation. To map the Rn, it is necessary to combine remote sensing observations with surface and atmospheric data, where the spatial variability is mainly modeled by means of albedo, emissivity, and land surface
