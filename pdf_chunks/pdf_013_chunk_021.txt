be identified visually and will be verified on automated snow cover product generated using INSAT 3D(R). This may also be extended to visually map snow covers and validate these map with operationally derive snow cover products. 1.6.3. Comparison of INSAT 3D(R) snow maps with AWiFS snow products INSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by AWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap results with these independently produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified that will permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one another. 1.7. Future Scope This algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI (available from AWiFS product or any other source) and infrared brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively. INSAT 3D being a coarse resolution satellite, Approach using AWiFS snow products has been developed, however scatterplot shows a spread over different range which could be due to geolocation error. An attempt will also be made using different techniques such as homogeneity test, histogram matching etc. to reduce the scatter due to mismatch INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 23 probably arising due to geolocation error. This will further help to improve fractional snow cover product to improve the accuracy of snow cover areal extent. References Clarke, A.D. and K.J. Noone, 1985.
