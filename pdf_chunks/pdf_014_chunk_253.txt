April. In January and February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low radiation and temperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad. The rise and fall of computed ETo was well captured in estimated ETo during January to April. The RMSD was 9.3 INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 220 mm which is 28.9% of AMS mean for the stated period. The 1:1 scatter (Figure 8) showed a 91 % correlation. Table 8.

During this period rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal temporal profile of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount of deviation during April. This may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop and was only captured in computed ETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. The temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 to 30 mm in January with gradual rise in February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due to rise in temperature and radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the estimates. The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with respect to
