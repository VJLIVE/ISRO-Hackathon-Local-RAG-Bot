259 -----(15) Physical retrieval involves minimization of the following cost function (Rodgers 1976): J(X)=[Ym – Y(X)]T.E-1.[Ym – Y(X)] + (X - X0)T.H-1.(X – X0) --------- (16) Minimization uses the following non-linear Newtonian iteration: Xn+1 = Xn + J”(Xn)-1.J’(Xn) -------- (17) This gives the following non-linear iterative form (Eyre 1989): Xn+1 = X0 + (Kn T E -1 Kn + H) -1. {Kn T E -1 [dYn m + Kn (Xn – X0)]} -------- (18) Where, X is the atmospheric profile to be retrieved, X0 is the initial state of the atmospheric profile or the first guess, Ym is the observed brightness temperature vector, E is the observation error covariance matrix that includes instrument noise and forward model error, H is the a priori matrix that constrains the solution, which can be first guess error covariance matrix or another type of matrix. Usually H=I, where  is the smoothing factor. Therefore, Xn+1 = X0 + (Kn T E -1 Kn + nI) -1. {Kn T E -1 [dYn m + Kn (Xn – X0)]} ------ (19) Smoothing factor  is very important in the solution and very difficult to determine. If  is too large then the solution is over-constrained and large biases could be created in the retrieval, while if  is too small, the solution is less constrained, and possibly unstable. The value  is dependent upon the observations, the observation error, and the first guess of the atmospheric profile, and often chosen empirically (Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988). Often it is chosen empirically (Susskind 1984; Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988). Li at al. (2000) uses discrepancy principle (Li and Huang 1999) to determine  and is changed in each iteration according to n+1 = qn.n ---------- (20) q is a factor for  increasing or decreasing.
