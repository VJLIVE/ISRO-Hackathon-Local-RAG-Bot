which could best predict the 85 GHz Tb under "nonscattering" conditions for the ocean surface in question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, a measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could be determined. The form of the Scattering Index method (SI) is as follows: With the seven channels of SSM/I, we name E(19V, 21V)85v as the estimated value of TB85v by TB19v and TB21v. Based on the data set of rain free areas, we will regress a formula E(19v, 21V)85v as follows, which was used to estimate the value of TB85v: E(19V, 21V)85v = a + bTB19v + cTB21v + TB21v2 It has been well established (Yao et al. 2001, Mishra et al. 2007) that when it is not raining, E(19V, 21V)85v can represent well the value of TB85v. The Scatering Index over the ocean thus can be defined as the difference between E(19V, 21V)85v (the estimated value of TB85v) and TB85v (the observed value of TB85v): SIO = E(19V, 21V)85v –TB85v SIO = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v – Tb85v where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set of SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive evaluation, it could be found that a threshold SI value could be a good, global indicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also causes the detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can cause a similar scattering signature, a set of "screens" would be developed to remove such features based on the screening approach of Ferraro et al. 1996. . The desert check involves the use of polarization information at 19 GHz, while the separation of rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving the
