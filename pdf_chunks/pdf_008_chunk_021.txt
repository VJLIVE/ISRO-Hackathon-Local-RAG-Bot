IMD WWR for 10 weeks from 3 July to 10 September 2014. The Fig. 16 when compared with Fig. 5 (a), shows a marked improvement in the comparison of H-E rain with WWR rain values, both in terms of correlation as well as standard deviation of their difference. This is despite of the fact that range of the rain values plotted in Fig. 16 is higher compared to that in Fig. 5 (a). The Fig. 16 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the week-by-week comparison statistics is provided in Table 3 below.

In order to see the comparison results in better perspectives, we have also used TRMM 3B42 V7 observations and compared their weekly met-subdivision averaged values with corresponding H-E and WWR rain values. This is shown in Table 4 below. Table 4: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged 3B42 V7 rain with IMD WWR and H-E rain.
