2015 50 IMD at every one hourly time interval on 1x1 and 0.25x0.25 deg grid resolution for GPI and IMSRA techniques. The rainfall from DWRs should be well calibrated and the products should be well converted to rain rate using an appropriate Z-R relation well tested and validated over Indian regional sites of the respective radar locations. In some cases one hourly rainfall from fast response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas where the DWR coverage is not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain rates, and hourly and daily gauge rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important. The Eta / IMD model forcast/analysed fields of total precipitable water (TPW) and relative humidity fields should be available from IMD at every 3 hourly within 0.5x0.5 respectively. 4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 4.4.1 Overview: NOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. Heavy precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the global scale to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite- derived algorithms, conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide information on these various scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and flash floods. In the satellite data, global scale connections between the tropics and middle latitudes are observed. These connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor that are often associated with unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic scale, the 6.7 ÔÅ≠m water vapor is especially Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Total Water Vapour Relative Humidity Doppler Weather Radar - Surface Rain Surface Rain Gauge on hourly basis (from Fast Response Rain Gauges, AWS ) and Total Day basis 0.5 X 0.5 deg 0.5 X
