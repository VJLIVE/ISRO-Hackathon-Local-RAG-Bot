channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for application to rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective rainfall areas using split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 1987a,b, 1997) and are instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 1985). These techniques rely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level cumulus clouds using the two window channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 µm (the so-called split window). The information content of the split window channels partially corrects erroneous rainfall area delineation (and consequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple IR techniques producing better false alarm ratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 µm channel of GOES-8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable for applications to rainfall detection and estimation. This channel was included for a long time in NOAA/AVHRR instruments (centered at 3.7 µm) for a variety of purposes including ice discrimination and sun-glint detection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for rainfall retrieval using the 11 and 3.9 µm channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use and sensitivity to the presence of ice and water vapor. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 165 In the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be developed and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of NOAA from the data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard INSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6μm, NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm, IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. 15.2.2.
