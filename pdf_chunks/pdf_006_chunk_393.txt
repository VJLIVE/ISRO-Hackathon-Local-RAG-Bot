Daily, monthly basis MEERA 2D / NCEP 19.7 Study of Potential Evapo-transpiration with K1 VHRR data The spatio-temporal pattern of monthly cumulative ETo for year 2011 is shown in Figure 3. The gradual increase and decrease was observed throughout the year with the seasonal Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Temporal resolution Spatial resolution Daily Potential Evapo-transpiration output consist of (i) ET0 (ii) Latitude (iii)Longitude mmd-1 0.5 5°N 68°E 15 40°N 100°E 80 to 90% Daily Ten-day ~ 5 km Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 320 transition. Monthly ETo linearly increased throughout India from January to June and then decreased in monsoon during July and August. After that, gradual rise in September coincident to higher insolation due to with drawl of monsoon. The ETo again decreases in October and November but there is rise in western part of India during December due to increase in day length in last dekad of December. Figure 3. Example of monthly distribution of ET0 from VHRR insolation and WRF forecasts over Indian region 19.7.1 Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting The sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‘Sobol’ method. It consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent samples of ‘N’ repetitions (rows) and ‘k’ input variables (columns), retrieved from existing data or randomly generated data from the probability distribution function (PDF) of each ‘k’ input variable. One or several variables in the first sample are substituted by the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each of the (2k - 1) possible combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‘N’ runs of the model are computed.
