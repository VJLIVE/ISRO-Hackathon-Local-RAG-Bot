Analysed chlorophyll OCF data exhibits a positive bias of 0.24 mg/m3 and is partially attributed to the positive bias in OCM-3 chlorophyll observations. Among the three CHL datasets, analysed CHL shows a lower percentage error, indicating better performance. Figure 10. Bio-Argo buoy locations for the validation period.

Chlorophyll from various sources for the days 02 Jan 2025 and 10Jan2025 is shown in figures 11 and 12. Figure 11: Chlorophyll from various sources for the day 02 Jan 2025. a) Coupled model chlorophyll, (b) Analysed Chlorophyll, c) OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll (New Version), and d) Merged product from multi satellites.

As suggested by the ATBD review committee, a part of their work with analysed chlorophyll fields are also included here. Monthly analysed chlorophyll for the global ocean has been generated by SAC at 25 km resolution using multi-satellite derived chlorophyll and TOPAZ model for the duration 1998 to 2015 and is provided
