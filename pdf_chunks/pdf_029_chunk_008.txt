to the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over land for the Indian region using OCM-2 data. The 8 secondary objective is to derive fine-mode fraction which is a proxy information about the particle size distribution and can be associated with anthropogenic sources of aerosols. The overall objectives of the aerosol retrieval are:  To determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 550 nm and 700-meter spatial resolution over land within an uncertainty of 20%.  To derive fine mode fraction as a qualitative indicator of anthropogenic pollution sources. As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical depth cannot be found for cloudy pixels therefore optical thickness retrievals apply only under clear and daytime conditions. 3.0 Inputs 3.1 Static Data Input Name Resolution Units Source Digital elevation model (DEM) 1.0 km meters (GLOBE) Digital Elevation Model, Version 1.0, NOAA, (Hastings et al., 1999) Spectral response function (SRF) 1.0 nanometres dimensionless SEDA/SAC/ISRO 3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Input Name Resolution Quantization Units Source OCM-2 radiometrically corrected TOA radiance in channels centred at 443, 490, 550, 620 and 865 nm 360 x 250 meters 12 bit mW/cm2/nm/sr HDF L1 B data file (NRSC) Sun-sensor geometry pixel - degree HDF L1 B data file (NRSC) Latitude/Longitude pixel - 0N / 0E HDF L1 B data file (NRSC) 3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs Input Name Resolution Units Source Ozone 1.0 x 1.25 degree, Monthly Dobson TOMS, NASA (Richard et al., 1998) Simulated TOA radiance 6 degree interval sun- sensor geometry angles mW/cm2/nm/sr Pre-calculated from RT model Fine mode aerosol type 1 degree dimensionless Levy et al., 2007 (based on in-situ data from AEROET) 4.0 Algorithm Functional Specifications 4.1 Overview 9 Aerosol retrievals from polar-orbiting satellite data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of NASA’s, Aqua and Terra Satellites, Visible
