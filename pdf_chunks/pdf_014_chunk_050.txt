Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key variables in hydrological cycle, agricultural drought and crop yield deviation. It is a term used to describe the combined loss of water due to the evaporation largely from soil surface and transpiration from plants. ET is a central process in the climate system and a nexus of water, energy & carbon cycle (Jung et.al. 2010). Land evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential component in global water, energy and carbon cycles, and provides a link between the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface (Betts et al., 1996; Jiménez et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015). It is also an important indicator of hydrologic and heat variations under a changing climate and
