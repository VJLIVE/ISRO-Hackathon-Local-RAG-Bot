cm (rms). 5.2. Altimeter Range An altimeter operates by sending out a short pulse of radiation and measuring the time required for the pulse to return from the sea surface. This measurement, called the altimeter range, gives the distance between the instrument and the sea surface, provided that the velocity of the propagation of the pulse and the precise arrival time are known. The mono frequency altimeter on SARAL/AltiKa performs only range measurements at Ka band frequencies (see range parameter). The range reported on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR has already been corrected for a variety of calibration and instrument effects, including calibration errors, pointing angle errors, center of gravity motion, and terms related to the altimeter acceleration such as Doppler shift and oscillator drift. The sum total of these corrections also appears on the (O)(I)GDR for Ka band range (see net_instr_corr_range parameter). 5.3. Geoid The geoid is an equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field that is closely associated with the location of the mean sea surface. The reference ellipsoid is a bi-axial ellipsoid of revolution. The center of the ellipsoid is ideally at the center of mass of the Earth although the center is usually placed at the origin of the reference frame in which a satellite orbit is calculated and tracking station positions given. The separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is the geoid undulation (see geoid parameter). The geoid undulation, over the entire Earth, has a root mean square value of 30.6 m with extreme values of approximately 83 m and -106 m. Although the geoid undulations are primarily long wavelength phenomena, short wavelength changes in the geoid undulation are seen over seamounts, trenches, ridges, etc., in the oceans. The calculation of a high resolution geoid requires high resolution surface gravity data in the region of
