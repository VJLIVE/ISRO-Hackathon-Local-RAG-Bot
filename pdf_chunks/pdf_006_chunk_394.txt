function (PDF) of each ‘k’ input variable. One or several variables in the first sample are substituted by the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each of the (2k - 1) possible combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‘N’ runs of the model are computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called sensitivity or Sobol’ indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition of the total variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous variations of the ‘k’ model inputs. Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 321 In oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest area (SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from November to February), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET0 values calculated using P-M method (e.g. 38% of ET0 total variance in January). Then come relative humidity and air temperature (32% and 17% of ET0 total variance in January, respectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air temperature and daily amplitude of relative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration process during winter. This trend changes during March and October. From April to September, ET0 is mostly sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in July). From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature and their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of ET0 variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to other variables’ variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during summer, and wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B). In Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation
