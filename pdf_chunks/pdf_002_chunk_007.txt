variations in the surface emissivity, surface and atmospheric temperature, water vapor, cloud liquid water or wind speed may produce the brightness temperature (Tb) variations of the same order as that due to rain rates. Apart from that the uncertainties observed in the brightness temperature versus rain rate relationship due to horizontal and vertical rain variability within satellite IFOV makes it extremely difficult to differentiate low rain rates from the background field (Varma et al., 2004). The rain identification over the land is even more complex due to strong and highly varying emissivity, especially at low microwave frequencies. Varma and Pal (2012) have provided a detailed account of the problem of precipitation detection by passive microwave measurements. Here, we intend to develop a rain identification algorithm using SAPHIR brightness temperature measurements. Because of high atmospheric opacity at frequencies near the water vapor absorption line (183.31 GHz), the measurements are nearly independent of the surface emissivity (Hong et al., 2005), but the cloud structure over land is different than the oceans (Kawamoto and Suzuki, 2013, Varma and Liu, 2006); Clouds over land usually develop much deeper than that over the oceans, and therefore, they may exhibit different brightness temperature depression for a given rain rate. Furthermore, unlike passive microwave radiometers with conical scan mechanism that are traditionally used for rain measurement, like SSM/I, TMI, MADRAS, etc., the SAPHIR incidence angle at each scan position differs and that has to be incorporated in any retrieval algorithm. Ideally, the pixels that are equidistant from the nadir on a scan line should have same incidence angle. But such pixels may still have asymmetry resulting from radio frequency interference problem of the instrument (Buehler et al., 2005). Thus we have attempted the development of the algorithm by considering all 182 pixels independently over land and oceans.
