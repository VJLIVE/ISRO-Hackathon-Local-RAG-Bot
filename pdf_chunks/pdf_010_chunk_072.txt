By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing the variations in their amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in polarization state, DWR quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium within the pulse volume. The amount of received power from the distributed target depends on the number of particles within the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, shape, orientation etc. The DWR’s are located at Kolkatat, Chennai, Muchlipattanm and Shri-Harikota (SHAR). The SHAR radar is S-band and Doppler. It is situated as an Island north of Chennai. All are working operationally. DWR’s estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation
