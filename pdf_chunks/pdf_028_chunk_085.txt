derived refractivity profiles do not reach the surface and are often available only up to altitudes of 1 km and above only. Also, knowledge of near-surface refractivity requires information on surface specific humidity and hence in practice the second option is not feasible. 6.4 Operational Implementation For ease of operational implementation, the algorithm will be formalized into a software to be designed and developed in a modular fashion. Different functions of the algorithm, as compositely shown in the flowchart in the following sub- section, will be divided into five sub-modules, the first four sub-modules performing specific pre-processing of the principal input (i.e. Level-1 refractivity profile) as well as the auxiliary data, dry computation and water vapor point Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 74 location before feeding into the fifth module for “wet retrieval”. The next sub- section depicts a detailed flowchart of the algorithm 6..4.1 Algorithm Flowchart 6.4.2 Inputs: The inputs for the algorithm can be classified as static and dynamic as detailed in the next sub-sections: 6.4.2.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Meteorological constants N.A.
