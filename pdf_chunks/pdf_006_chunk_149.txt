to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values observed in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested pixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, yet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., 1998). 7.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination Snow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow reflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their generally-high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of the spectrum. While the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. This algorithm will be further improves, as INSAT 3D Met payload is having thermal bands. Appropriate brigtness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al., 2003). This will be additional criteria than in build criteria of NDSI. 7.4.1.1.4 Estimation of Snow Reflectance Various parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral irradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth- sun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum and minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain slope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local illumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation incident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. Markham and Barker
