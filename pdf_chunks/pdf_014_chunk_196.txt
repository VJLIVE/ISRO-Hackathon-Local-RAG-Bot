(6.7 m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring, intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, movement, and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine how much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Doppler Weather Radar - Surface Rain Surface Rain Gauge on hourly basis (from Fast Response Rain Gauges, AWS ) and Total Day basis Original DWR grid resolutions 70% as compared with ground based data DWR observations at IMD Sites (Every 1/2 Hour, ------ At IMD Sites --- --- TRMM / GPM Rainfall 1.

High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal data sets used in this diagnosis. Large scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale precipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. Satellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) estimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) estimation of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day to a month e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some statistical relationship. In case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when available to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve
