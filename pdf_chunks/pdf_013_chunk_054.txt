ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 48 4.2.2. Objectives The objectives of this document are: (i) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of day-time and daily Evapotranspiration (ET) over land in all-sky conditions (ii) To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for automation of ET product generation (iii) To describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements and other available satellite-based and reanalysis products. 4.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 4.2.3.1. Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT- 3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the earth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55- 0.75 µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1 µm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 µm & 11.5-12.5 µm) regions. It also has 19 channel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The spatial resolution is 1 km x 1 km for VIS/SWIR band and 4 km x 4 km for thermal IR and 8 km X 8 km bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) (2014) provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D/3DR data products scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition
