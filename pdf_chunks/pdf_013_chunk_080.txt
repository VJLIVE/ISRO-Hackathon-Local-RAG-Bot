sw a T    (5) Where, Tsw = Atmospheric Transmissivity Tsw will be derived from the ratio of incoming shortwave radiation (Rsi) to extra-terrestrial radiation (Rext). The extra-terrestrial radiation will be computed using astronomical units for INSAT pixel for each instanteous acquisition. The air temperature (Ti) will be integrated from hourly daily weather forecast from WRF as mentioned in section 2.3.3. Rloclr again is function of surface emissivity and land surface temperature as defined in equation 4 s s loclr T R    (6) Where, Ɛs = Air emissivity, σ= Stefan Blotzmann constant & Ts = Land Surface Temperature (LST) The daily surface emissivity will be generated from 10-years MODIS emissivity product or from NDVI products from OCM-2, AWiFS India mosaic products as per the availability and quality of data. The land surface temperature will be taken from already operationalize INSAT product. Hence by doing computation of equations 1 to 6 Rnclr will be estimated for day time. In night time only net longwave radiation will exist hence only equation (3) will be taken in consideration for computation of clear sky Rnclr. 5.4.2. Cloudy sky net surface radiation (Rncld) For cloudy pixel the empirical model will be developed among INSAT derived out going longwave radiation (OLR), insolation product and measured net radiation from AMS and eddy tower data over different agro-climatic conditions of India for day and night time separately. Net shortwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rnscld) Rnscld_day = (1-α) Rsicld ( 7) α- Albedo will computed from moving last 20-day composite. Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during daytime Rlincld_day = f (Ta, RH, CI) (8) Where Ta = Air temperature, RH = Relative humidity, CI = Clearness Index Incoming longwave radiation in cloudy pixel (Rlincld) during night time Rlincld_night = f (Ta, RH)
