the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex number j i j i c j i v i u V , , ,   . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height). Fig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process. Here X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector differences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as   t j i c t j i dif V V V , , , ,   . Here c V represents the current vector at (i, j) point and t j i V , , neighborhood vectors with 1 1 , 1 1       j i and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 3. If all spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 27 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 3 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences dif V , excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 141 the set. In the next step, set of vector differences 
