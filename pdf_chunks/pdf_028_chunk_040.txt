can also be retrieved, which is discussed in a separate MT ATBD. The parameters are to be retrieved under the non-raining situations because at the microwave frequencies used for retrieval of the above parameters the emission due to rain is very strong and than obscure the effect of the other parameters. The table-2 provides the radiative transfer model calculated change in the brightness temperatures at 19, 21 and 37 GHz frequencies due to 1 mm h-1 of rain rate. It may be noted that a low raining condition of rain rate 1 mm h-1, can even change the brightness temperature significantly.

The study indicates high sensitivity for SST only at frequencies < 10 GHz. Hence the SST retrieval from MADRAS is not included in this document. The wind has high senstivity at 19 and
