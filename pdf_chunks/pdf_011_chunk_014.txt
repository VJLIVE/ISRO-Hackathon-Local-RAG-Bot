(9) that except some locations the difference between INSAT-3D/3DR SST and GHRSST is within Â±1K when retrieved through proposed algorithm. While the difference between operational SST and GHRSST products is as high as 2.5 to 3K in case of INSAT-3D and as low as -2.5 to -3K in case of INSAT-3DR. This clearly indicates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the operational one.

Among those thermal gradient is one of the most important features of the SST which is required to study various mesoscale oceanic processes as well as a serves as an indicator of potential fishery zones (PFZ). Thermal gradients from GHRSST daily products is shown in figure (10). Fig. 10: Thermal gradient from daily GHRSST for 13th December 2017. SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 17 The thermal gradients computed from daily products of INSAT-3D/3DR SST retrieved through proposed and operational algorithm for 13th December 2017 are shown in the following figures (11) and (12). This work has been carried out with our colleagues from oceanic sciences division (OSD). (a) (b) Fig. 11: Thermal gradients from daily INSAT-3D SST (a) Operational (b) New (a) (b) Fig. 12: Thermal gradients from daily INSAT-3DR SST (a) Operational (b) New On comparing figures (11) and (12) with figure (10), we can see that for both INSAT-3D & 3DR the SST gradients calculated from the daily SST products retrieved through proposed algorithm is closer to GHRSST gradients as compared to gradients calculated from SST retrieved through operational algorithm. The above initial validation exercise confirms the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the operational one.
