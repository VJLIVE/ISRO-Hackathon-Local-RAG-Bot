pixel and the difference between the fire pixel and its background temperature. In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of fire. 8.4.1 Overview 8.4.1.1 Theoretical Background  Any object above absolute zero ( 0 K; -273.16o C; -459.69o F) emits EMR.  As temp. increases the maxima shifts towards shorter wave length. Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 134  λmax=2897/T ; µm (Wien’s displacement law) can give max. W.L. at which the exitance is maximum & is related to Temp. (e,g, λmax=9.66 µ at 300o K) INSAT MIR Channel (3.70 to 3.95µm) is located near the spectral maximum for radiative emission for objects radiating at temperature around 400 to 1200 K. this temperature is closed to the temperature of burning forest biomass. INSAT, TIR-I Channel (10.20µm – 11.30µm) and TIR-II (11.5µm to 12.5µm) are located near the spectral maxima for normal environment temperature i.e. around 300 K (fig.1). Therefore, both these channels will be useful in fire detection algorithms. Figure.1. Plank Function and the location of AVHRR channel 3 and 4 and INSAT- 3D Channel 3, 5 and 6 Fire detection algorithms using daily NOAA –AVHRR images developed by Li. et al., (2000) and latest version of Fire Identification, Mapping and Monitoring algorithms (FIMMA) developed by NOAA/NESDIS will be evaluated. Pixel will be flagged as containing fire if the values of its brightness temperature and or reflectance exceeds or falls below certain predetermined threshold values, which are fixed during development IN-ch3 IN-ch5 IN-ch6 Atm. window 3 8 14 CO2 CO2 O3 Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 135 phase. Visible and SWIR bands will be utilized for masking clouds and water bodies. Contextual Algorithm (Giglio, et al., 1999: and Kaufman, et al., 1998) is proposed at this stage.
