and Atmospheric Structures) The proposed MADRAS system is a five-channel, self-calibrating, microwave radiometer system. This radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water parameters in the tropical belt. The choice of the channels has been driven by their potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above, from the experience of processing other radiometer data. Table 1 below shows the brief description of MADRAS sensor.
