and PR observations of rainy pixels and calculate rain rate from SAPHIR observations at each pixel location and compared with the PR rain rates. This provides a correlation of 8 0.70, rms error of 0.81 mm/h and bias of 0.04 mm/h for total number of observations of about 0.94 million. When we consider all the collocated SAPHIR and PR observations from the training dataset comprising of rain as well as no rain observations, the correlation still remains 0.68 with an rms error of 0.45 mm/h, and bias of 0.01 mm/h for total number of 2.06 million observations. If this algorithm is used operationally, the SAPHIR observations subjected to the rain retrieval algorithm would not be pre- classified as rainy or non-rainy and hence the statistics provided in the latter case provides the algorithm accuracy. In order to test the algorithm with independent dataset, we have collocated SAPHIR and PR measurement for another one month of April 2013 by following the same procedure for collocation as done for training dataset. We refer this dataset as test dataset and apply the algorithm to the test dataset and compare the rain from SAPHIR with that from PR. With a test dataset we find a correlation of 0.58, rms error of 0.91 mm/h and bias of 0.07 mm/h for total number of observations of 2.3 million. These results are very encouraging given the high temporal variability of precipitation (Piyush et al., 2012) and possible imperfection in preparing collocated dataset of SAPHIR and PR as discussed earlier. These results appear to be more encouraging in view of similar comparison that we carried out between TMI and PR for a period of 10 days from 21-30 May 2009 that shows a correlation of 0.61, rms error of 2.23 mm/h, and bias of 0.1 mm/h for total
