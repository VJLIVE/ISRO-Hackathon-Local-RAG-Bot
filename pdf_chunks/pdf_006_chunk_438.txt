Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E. 1.6 Validation 1.6.1 Data required Co located radiosonde measurements of temperature, humidity and geopotential heights. Geopotential heights from NCEP/ECMWF reanalysis. 1.6.2 Methods of Validation Difference between radiosonde/reanalysis geopotential heights, mean bias, standard deviation etc are calculated. 1.7 Technical Issues (limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles. A simple calculation assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa shows that a 0.5 K error in vT will result in about 10 m error in 500 hPa geopotential height. To a first approximation, error in vT is of the same order of T. Hence achieving less than 10 m error in 500 hPa geopotential height demands that errors in retrieved temperatures be less than 0.5 K. 1.8 References Meteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole (Pub.), 502 pp. Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution GPH Meters - - +/- 10 m 0.5 x 0.5 deg Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 369 21.2.

Presence of air mass lightens the air mass thereby increasing the potential for convective activity. As an air parcel rises, it cools dry adiabatically until saturation vapor pressure is reached. Once saturation vapor pressure is reached some of the water vapor condenses forming liquid droplets,
