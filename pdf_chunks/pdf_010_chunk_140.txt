(Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time consuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is developed and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic can be effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al. 1995). 7.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover and Depth One of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004). This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. In this technique combination of visual
