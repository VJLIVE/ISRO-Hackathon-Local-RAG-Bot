and Doppler. It is situated as an Island north of Chennai. All are working operationally. DWR’s estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation needs. Ground-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO’s AWS etc), at high resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High resolution IMD DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several small size study sites with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for instance in 1°x 1° degrees. The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5°x 0.5° to 2°x 2° degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an hourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would be required on routine basis, preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5°x0.5° grids. Pre-launch Field Experiments Pre-launch validation campaign will be launched for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A based rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D. A three months period will be selected (mainly rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain gauges and the algorithm will be tested. Post-Launch Special Field Experiments Many of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented for the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground
