(SAPHIR) instrument is developed by IPSL and Observatoire de Paris as part of the MEGHA-TROPIQUES payload to study the vertical distribution of water vapour in the tropical troposphere, with two specific objectives: 1. Analysis of the diurnal cycle of the water vapour distribution, to evaluate the vertical transports associated with convective structures at the mesoscale and the large scale, and to understand the scale-to-scale interactions in the meridional flux 2. Study of the role of the space-time distribution of humidity on the development of deep convection. An additional aim is to improve parameterizations of humidity related processes in AGCM. The need for such an instrument on the Megha Tropiques platform was driven by the following main reasons: Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 45 a) Scarcity of accurate and frequent water vapour profile measurements in tropical latitudes for studying convective system life cycle. b) Existing and other future sounders are planned to be onboard polar orbiting satellites leading to heterogeneous data. 4.2.2 Objectives  To retrieve humidity profile in 6 layers of the atmosphere from 1000 to 100 mb.  To validate the retrieved profiles with concurrent radiosonde, satellites observations and NWP model fields.  To improve the retrievals based on the validation feedback. 4.3 Instrument characteristics: Six SAPHIR channels are centered on major water vapour absorbing band at 183.31 GHz. The following table shows the details of its bandwidths etc. Table1: SAPHIR Channels characteristics 4.4 Inputs: 4.4.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Land /Sea Mask Pixel ( ~4 km) 1 pixel USGS Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 46 4.4.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected brightness temperatures of 6 SAPHIR channels Each pixel /Grid 16-bit <1K Derived from raw data by DP Geolocation of all the SAPHIR channels Each pixel/ Grid 16-bit 1
