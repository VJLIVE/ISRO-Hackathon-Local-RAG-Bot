for the radiative transfer computations are: atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapour, and ozone concentrations. These simulations are carried out for average profiles corresponding to different months. Regression analysis is carried out separately for each satellite and each months independently and the regression coefficients are obtained between [UTH/cos()] and water vapour channel brightness temperature, where  is zenith angle. These coefficients may be used to retrieve the UTH from satellite observations of water Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 238 vapour channel by choosing appropriate coefficient represent the particular satellite and month of observation. 15.4.2.2 Flow Chart INSAT/Kalpana IR and WV data files Conversion from Grey count to Brightness Temp.

This LUT file is provided along with the data set. 15.4.2.2 Step 2 : Cloud detection: All the data in the cold space and data falling beyond the 60 radius from the sub-satellite points are excluded from further calculations. Cloudy pixels are identified and these pixels are also excluded from further calculations. The threshold used to eliminate the cloudy pixel is that if brightness temperature of thermal IR window channel is less than or equal to 270 and if the UTH calculated at
