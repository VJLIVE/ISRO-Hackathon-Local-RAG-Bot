pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same distance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 170 location. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those targets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude lower than 600 hPa). This "initial" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous Infrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). Once the infrared tracers heights using the above three algorithms and water vapor tracers heights
