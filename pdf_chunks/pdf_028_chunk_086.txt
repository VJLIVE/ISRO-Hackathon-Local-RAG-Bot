In addition to the profile of output parameters, time and location are mentioned in the file as scalars. The overall format of the output file is in standard netcdf. 6.5 Validation: 6.5.1 Data Required: i) Comparison with collocated radiosonde measurements of temperature, pressure and water vapor pressure profile. ii) Comparison with collocated NCEP/ECMWF or both. iii) Comparison with existing COSMIC data, collocated in space and time. 6.5.2 Methods of Validation: The validation is to be carried out between the various "truth" data, as mentioned above, and ROSA retrieved geophysical parameters, collocated spatially and
