retrieval routines to remove the bias between sounder observations and the radiative transfer model computations. 4.9 Future scope: The present study does not include the sensitivity of SAPHIR channels to land emissivity variations and clouds. Inclusion of such cases will definitely improve the quality of humidity profiles. In order to minimize the surface contribution in the lower frequency SAPHIR channels inclusion of 150 GHz brightness temperature from MADRAS is also desirable that will be taken up in future.. 4.10 References 1.
