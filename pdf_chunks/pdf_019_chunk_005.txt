et al., 1997; Kaufman et al., 2002). Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited to one (GOES) or two channels (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) were used first to derive the total aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model. The relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the look up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information on the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the corrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical thickness. The approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required for aerosol optical depth retrieval. In dark vegetation approach for aerosol retrieval a near-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated pixels, then the surface reflectance in the visible bands is calculated from the observed reflectance in the near-IR band. The optical thickness is initially calculated assuming a continental aerosol model. The suspended matter information is used to choose a better aerosol model and more accurate values of optical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997). In spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to once or twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar satellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such sparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show little systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show significant diurnal patterns (Bergin et al. 2001). It is required to understand aerosol plume movement to track and forecast plume movement in the interest of human health. Therefore, it is important to monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol. The
