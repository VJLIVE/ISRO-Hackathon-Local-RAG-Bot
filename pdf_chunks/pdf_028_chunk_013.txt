Algorithm functional specifications 2.5.1 Overview: Microwave brightness temperatures measured from a satellite-borne radiometer results from the integrated effects of surface emission and reflection, absorption and emission by atmospheric gases, and absorption, emission and multiple scattering of cloud and precipitation particles. Once scattering in the atmosphere becomes important (at 85.5 GHz, in particular for cases two and four), the influence of the model treatment of multiple scattering overrides the surface effect. To accurately describe the microwave signatures, a radiative transfer model with full inclusion of the aforementioned effects, particularly the multiple scattering by precipitation particles, is required. The Theory of radiative transfer basically describes the interaction and propagation of radiative energy in a medium. As radiation is the most important source of energy for driving all the atmospheric processes and also atmospheric dynamics is strongly influenced by how solar and the terrestrial radiations are scattered, absorbed and emitted by the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Thus the knowledge of radiative transfer is most fundamental in the retrieval of atmospheric and earth’s surface parameters in space-borne remote sensing. The extensive coverage of radiative transfer formulations has been made by Chandrasekhar (1960). 2.5.2 Theoretical Background: It is the fundamental integro-differential equation, which governs the variation of intensity in a medium characterized by a spectral volumetric absorption coefficient, K(s), and a spectral volumetric scattering coefficient, (s), where s is the distance along the absorbing path.
