σ0G = σ0M, the Kpi value cannot be calculated from σ0M. For this reason, all Kpi values are first initialized to zero, and then Wki and corresponding Kpi are calculated through GMF using equations (4) and (2), respectively. The Wk is recalculated using the updated values of Kpi, and the procedure is repeated till Wk is converged yielding final Kpi and Wk. Since Kp value is already used in Wk, ignoring Kp in equation (5) yields NV as NVk = Σ M i=1{(Wki - Wk) / Wk}2 10 The above term can also be expressed as normalized standard deviation (NSD) and standard deviation (SD) of wind speed derived from backscatter measurements as given below NSDk = (1/Wk)√[(1/M) Σ M i=1(Wki - Wk)2] 11 SDk = √[(1/M) Σ M i=1(Wki - Wk)2] 12 The present algorithm referred as NSDA makes use of parameter NSD for deriving as well as for ranking the wind vector solutions. As NSD or SD are obtained from Wki values which are derivable due to their closure form for a given trial direction, this approach becomes very efficient (Chi and Li, 1988). Based on SD without considering the measurement variance, an algorithm developed in-house was used for 16 SEASAT-A and ERS-1 scatterometers (Gohil and Pandey, 1985; Gohil, 1992; Gohil and Pandey, 1995). Retrieval algorithm using NSD ignoring Kp value was developed and tested with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 2006). In the present study, NSD considering the Kp value is used for ranking the solutions. The parameter SD is used for rain flagging discussed later. A block diagram of algorithm for retrieving wind vector solutions is given in figure (8).
