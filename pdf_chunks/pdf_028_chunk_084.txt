temperature quadratic is made, temperature profile in the first iteration is evaluated using dry pressure and water vapor pressure is calculated using the equation 5 2 10 73 . 3 6 . 77    PT N T e (14) Once a first estimate of e is made water vapor mixing ratio (w) is calculated using the formula P e w   622 . 0 (15) Thereafter, the virtual temperature (Tv) profile is calculated using the formula ) 0 . 1 ( )) * 61 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ( w w T Tv    (16) Once a virtual temperature profile is estimated, the pressure profile is re-estimated using the hydrostatic equation ) exp( dz T R g P P z z dry w w   (17) Where, Pw is pressure at the water vapor point zw. Re-estimated pressure is then used to calculate temperature, water vapor (and virtual temperature) profiles in successive iterations until the three profiles converge. It is worth noting that two options are possible here (not pointed out by O’Sullivan et al. (2000)): (i) keep the coefficients of temperature quadratic same throughout the iterations with R=Rdry approximation in equation (13), and (ii) update the right hand side integral in equation (13) with water vapor information and hence solve for fresh temperature quadratic coefficients in each iteration which requires refractivity profile available up to the surface or lower altitude. Currently, only the first option is considered as the radio occultation derived refractivity profiles do not reach the surface and are often available only up to altitudes of 1 km and above only. Also, knowledge of near-surface refractivity requires information on surface specific humidity and hence in practice the second option is not feasible. 6.4 Operational Implementation For ease of operational
