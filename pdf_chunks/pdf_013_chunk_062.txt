offset between the canopy composite temperature and the below-canopy soil surface temperature and is found as 1.5 h in Murray and Verhoef based on their data. With the two boundary values (i.e., Δt =1.5 h for fc=1 and Δt=0h for fc=0), a linear approach is proposed here to describe time offset Δt as function of vegetation fraction (fc). NDVI data from OCM, MSG-SEVRI or MODIS will be used to compute fc INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 54 Δt= 1.5 · fc (10) Once the soil heat flux is obtained then ɸ is solved if all clear-sky instances prevail throughout the day. 7.4.3 Cloudy sky Latent heat flux (λE cld) The latent heat flux under cloudy sky conditions can be estimated using equation (2). Under cloudy sky conditions LST is not available, so the challenge is to retrieve LST under cloudy-sky condtions through inverse modelling. 4.5. LST retrieval under cloudy-sky From the proposed net radiation product, the all-sky net radiation data are pre-requisite for LST recovery under cloudy-sky conditions. The net surface longwave radiation will be obtained as a difference from net surface radiation and net surface shortwave radiation under cloudy sky conditions. Net surface shortwave radiation will be obtained from instantaneous surface insolation product and noon-time sliding monthly albedo composite. The incoming longwave radiation will be deducted using WRF forecast data to retain outgoing longwave radiation (Rlocld). By inverting the equation of stefan-boltzmann law we can recover LST. LSTcloud = (Rlocld /(Ɛs σ))1/4 (11) Here under cloudy sky conditions the 30-day composite value of surface emissivity for cloudy pixel from from historical MODIS data or sliding monthly NDVI composite will be used. If the LST is recovered then by using equation 2, we can obtain latent heat flux under cloudy conditions. (LEcld) In this case also, like clear sky
