The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. (∆w) = |(wx − wW) l x} (∆u) = |(ux − uW) l x} To avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. 13.8. Technical Issues (Limitations etc.) Accuracy
