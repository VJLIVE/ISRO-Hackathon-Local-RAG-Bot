as a calibration point for all bands. In-orbit multipoint calibration of the IR channel is carried out through viewing of full Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 269 aperture high emissivity internal cavity, whose physical temperature is accurately monitored at multiple locations and transmitted in Sounder data stream. The detector outputs are individually amplified, integrated in synchronism with the filter wheel movement and digitized to twelve bits by A/D converter. The digitized data along with house keeping and calibration information is formatted, randomized and sent to transmitter as a serial data stream. The data rate is approximately 40 Kbps. The temperature control of the IR detector mounted on cooled patch as well as that of filter wheel will be achieved through proportional controller.
