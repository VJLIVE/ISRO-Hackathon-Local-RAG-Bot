2018 30 Because the temporal resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR will range from 15 (together) to 30 min (alone), we will set a minimum time step as 30 min. This means that we will calculate FRE by assuming that a fire can last for at least a half hour if there is one FRP observation. The half-hourly FRE is binned to calculate hourly biomass burning emissions. In near-real-time monitoring of biomass burning emissions, we will use INSAT-3D/3DR fire products from MMDRPS. The diurnal pattern of FRP will then be simulated for the previous day (0300 UTC – 0230 UTC for INSAT-3D & 0315UTC to 0245UTC for INSAT-3DR) for estimating fire emissions. As a result, the BBEP will be produced with a latency of 1 day. Daily and monthly emissions can be given as the sum of hourly values for a given region and an ecosystem type, separately. 2.3.2 Domain of operation The domain of application will be kept to 10° - 45°N, 45° - 105°E (covering SAARC countries, presently operational Asia_Mer Sector) and only to forest regions. 2.3.3 Global scenario FRP approach is adapted by WF_ABBA in the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin [Prins et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 2004]. Particularly, the WF_ABBA V65 detects instantaneous fires in subpixels using infrared bands around 3.9 and 10.7 mm from a network of geostationary satellite instruments that include SEVIRI on board the Meteosat-9, and Imagers on board both GOES and MTSAT. It then derives instantaneous FRP from radiances in single MIR [Wooster et al., 2003]. Further, to minimize false fire detections, the WF_ABBA uses a temporal filter to exclude the fire pixels that are only detected once within the past 12 h [Schmidt and Prins, 2003]. The WF_ABBA V65 has been installed in NOAA OSDPD (the Office of
