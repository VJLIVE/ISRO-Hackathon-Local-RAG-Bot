The SARAL payload (see Figure 3) includes the following components: SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 14 • An Altimeter, provided by CNES – the main mission instrument and a dual frequency microwave radiometer, provided by CNES – to correct the altimeter measurement for atmospheric range delays induced by water vapor. The AltiKa instrument consists of a Ka-band altimeter and an embedded dual frequency radiometer. • The radio positioning DORIS system, provided by CNES – for precision orbit determination using dedicated ground stations • A Laser Reflector Array (LRA), provided by CNES – to calibrate the orbit determination system. And the ARGOS-3 instrument (and associated components) that has its own mission on-board the SARAL satellite as part of the ARGOS system.

Sensors 2.6.2.1. AltiKa Altimeter The mono-frequency Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter is the main part of AltiKa instrument. Its functions are based on proven concepts and already developed sub-systems, as it inherits from Siral (CRYOSAT mission) and Poseidon3 (Jason-2 mission). The use of a single frequency is possible because ionosphere effects are negligible at such high frequencies (proportionality to the inverse of the squared frequency). The main advantage
