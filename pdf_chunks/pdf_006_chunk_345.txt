Detection 17.4.2.1 Selection of night time data only by using information of solar zenith angle and visible count 17.4.2.2 Conversion of grey count to brightness temperature Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 277 17.4.2.3 Gross cloud testing using 10.8 μm brightness temperature 17.4.2.4 High cloud elimination by using 10.8 μm brightness temperature threshold 17.4.2.5 Removal of remaining snow pixel by using 10.8 μm brightness temperature thresholding 17.4.2.6 Difference between 10.8 and 3.9 m channel brightness temperatures. 17.4.2.7 Fog detection (The minimum value of brightness temperature difference ΔTBmin above which the pixel is flagged to be fog is determined dynamically. It varies for thin, moderate and thick fog). Day Time Fog Detection (Requires R & D) 17.4.2.8 Selection of day time data only by using information of solar zenith angle 17.4.2.9 Conversion of grey count of visible to reflectance and TIR channel grey count to brightness temperate 17.4.2.10 Gross cloud check (dynamical threshold of 10.8 m channel brightness temperature). 17.4.2.11 Generation of cloud free scene using 15 day data prior to the fog episode for a particular time. 17.4.2.12 Use of temporal differencing technique to detect fog 17.4.2.13 Elimination of snow pixels and bright land pixel using a threshold for change in reflectance = (reflectance of sample image – reflectance of clear scene image) for a particular time. 17.4.2.14 If the = (reflectance of sample image – reflectance of clear scene image) for a particular time is greater than a definite threshold, then the pixel is classified as fog. 17.4.2.15 Surface homogeneity test is performed. The variation of reflectance is very less over the fog region which is used as a measure to identify fog. 17.5 Outputs Generation of Fog map Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution FOG (nighttime) and FOG(Day time) Flag (0 No fog, 1 Fog) Flag
