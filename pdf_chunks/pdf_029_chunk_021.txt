72.0 with an interval of 6.0 degrees and for sixteen Δ𝜙 values ranging from 0.0 to 180.0 with an interval of 12 degrees. For RT simulation several ready-to-use codes are freely available, however, in the current version of the algorithm, the discrete ordinate method is used for which CDISORT code is customized as per the need. 18 4.3.5 Aerosol inversion The radiance data for two blue channels (443 and 490 nm in the case of OCM-2) are then compared with modelled radiance. A maximum likelihood method is used to match the appropriate values of aerosol optical thickness at 550nm and mixing ratio to the measured radiance. For estimating the best solution, first AOD solutions using different aerosol models (represented by 12 values of fine mode fraction ranging from -0.1 to 1.1) is estimated by finding the perfect match between modelled and observed radiance in band-3 (490 nm), secondly among these best AOD solutions one is chosen as the final solution by comparing modelled and measured radiance in band-2 (443nm). The technique thus derived gives a procedure, which is performed on each cloud-free land pixel, giving one of the finest daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm and fine mode fraction. Mathematically for each pixel, a set of AOD and fine mode fraction is found for which the equations (13) and (14) are satisfied. 𝜌490 ∗ − 𝜌490 𝑇𝑂𝐴= 0, (13) 𝜌443 ∗ − 𝜌443 𝑇𝑂𝐴= 𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛. (14) Here 𝜌λ ∗ and 𝜌λ 𝑇𝑂𝐴 stands for satellite level modelled and measured signal (reflectance or radiance), respectively, for band cantered at wavelength λ and 𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛 stands for residual error. The satellite level modelled reflectance 𝜌𝑠𝑎𝑡 ∗ is estimated by linear mixing of satellite level modelled reflectance for fine mode and coarse mode aerosol models represented by symbols 𝜌λ,𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒 ∗ and 𝜌λ,𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 ∗
