the nadir on a scan line should have same incidence angle. But such pixels may still have asymmetry resulting from radio frequency interference problem of the instrument (Buehler et al., 2005). Thus we have attempted the development of the algorithm by considering all 182 pixels independently over land and oceans. In order to develop rain identification algorithm, we use concurrent observations from SAPHIR and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)- Precipitation Radar PR. Apart from PR, TRMM also carried onboard a microwave radiometer which is referred as Microwave Radiometer (TMI). Rain rates are provided by both TMI and PR. TMI operates at 10.65, 19.35, 21.3, 37.0, and 85.5 GHz with all frequencies, except 21.3 GHz (only V) received radiation in both vertical and horizontal polarizations. TRMM is a 5 low orbiting satellite, which provides coverage between about 36o S and 36o N latitudes. The PR scans ± 17° from the nadir with 49 positions result in a 215 km swath, with a spatial resolution of 4.3 km. In August 2001 the TRMM orbit was raised from 350 to 403 km, and that resulted to extended swath of 247 km and spatial resolution of ~5 km. In the present study, we use precipitation radar measurements taken from TRMM standard swath product 2A25, which contains the rainfall rates from surface to 20 km altitude with 250 m vertical resolution. We have also taken surface rain rates from TMI standard data product 2A12. The TRMM sensor package has been described by Kummerow et al. (1998), and PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et al. (1997). The TRMM sensor package has been described by Kummerow et al. (1998), and PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et al. (1997). The dataset of PR-SAPHIR concurrent observations is prepared by collocating SAPHIR and PR
