atmospheric general circulation models. At mid-latitudes they also indicate the underlying large-scale waves such as Rossby waves. By looking at the geopotential heights one can infer the first guess atmospheric wind pattern (also known as geostrophic approximation) especially for mid- latitudes. 1.2.2 Objective To derive geopotential heights at 40 pressure levels from 1000 hPa to 0.1 hPa. 1.3 Inputs 1.3.1 Static Data Topographic data at sounder horizontal resolution. 1.3.2 Dynamic Data Retrieved temperature and humidity profiles at 40 pressure levels Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 367 1.3.3 Other auxiliary and Model Inputs 1000 hPa analysed heights from IMD or ECMWF/NCEP or surface pressure and surface temperature. 1.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 1.4.1 Theoretical Background Given pressure, temperature and humidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any pressure level or thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level can be computed using the formula ) ln( P P g T R Z s v d  Ps – Surface Pressure, P – Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, vT - Layer mean virtual temperature. This can be computed at all the retrieved pressure levels. Virtual temperature Tv is given by T q Tv ) 61 .0 1(   where q is specific humidity expressed in Kg/Kg, T is temperature in K. Geopotential height (GPH) is then given by Z R Z R GPH o o   Where Ro = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. By using H instead of Z, one can use g = 9.8 ms-2, a constant value in calculations. In reality, g decreases slightly with altitude. Difference between Z and H can be as much as 16m at the height of 10 km above sea level depending on pressure, temperature
