about ± 19% on hourly basis and lesser for daily to monthly averaging. Moreover, the statistical models call for region- specific updates of coefficients through ground datasets which are time consuming. 20.2.2 Objectives The objectives of this document are : (i) To outline a physical algorithm for surface insolation estimation (ii) To highlight the sensitivity of algorithm and evaluation of estimates from this algorithm applied with Kalpana-1 VHRR data (iii) To describe the path of integrating algorithm with Indian geostationary satellite (e.g. INSAT 3D) based on cloud properties, aerosol, water vapour and ozone products Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 340 (iv) To implement the algorithm in a software compatible to IMDPS geophysical parameter retrieval chain for automated generation of instantaneous and daily insolation (v) To describe validation strategy of operational product of INSAT 3D insolation against in-situ measurements, reanalysis data, other satellite products (vi) To outline the scope of improvement in the accuracy of the estimates in future 20.2.3 Instrument characteristics The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS) and India Meteorological Department (IMD). It provides half-an-hour observations from six channel ‘Imager’ and 19-channel ‘Sounder’. The Imager has one broad VIS (0.55-0.75 m) band (1 km x 1 km), one SWIR (1.55 – 1.70 m) band (1km x 1km), one MIR (3.8 – 4.0 m) band (4 km x 4 km), one water vapour (6.5 - 7.1m) band (8 km x 8 km) and two split thermal (10.2 - 11.3 m, 11.5 - 12.5 m) bands (4 km x 4 km). The sounder has 19 channels to provide vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity. There are 22 geophysical products which are scheduled to be available from an operational processing known as INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS).
