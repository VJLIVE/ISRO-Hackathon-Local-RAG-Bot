quality assured rain gauges and the algorithm will be tested. Post-Launch Special Field Experiments Many of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented for the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be utilized for the INSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 63 validation campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual consultation with IMD. 4.7 Technical Issues: (Limitation etc.) The approaches for the retrieval of rainfall from these two techniques are distinctly different with different application areas in mind by NOAA. Thus the validity of these methods in Indian Tropical Regions is an important and still an open issue. For large scale rainfall GPI technique has been found suitable over tropical regions and can be implented. However, the inherent limitations of IR / VIS based methods due to their indirect measurements poses challenges for the accuracy of the rainfall products. More importantly GMSRA is the algorithms, which is a large effort from various scientific institutions put together for many years and then integrated at NOAA. To follow them for the algorithm development directly over tropical regions of India needs a lot of R & D, experience and innovations pertaining to the region. It is because, some of the steps like the cloud microphysics (estimation of effective radius of cloud particles, their optical properties etc.) and associated parameters estimation are the important but grey areas of research and can be accomplished fully only with the R&D efforts and experience in the field. In addition the GMSRA, however, is a highly specific to US regions particularly with very large spatial and temporal coverageâ€™s of
