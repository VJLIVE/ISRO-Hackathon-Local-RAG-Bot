Its functions are based on proven concepts and already developed sub-systems, as it inherits from Siral (CRYOSAT mission) and Poseidon3 (Jason-2 mission). The use of a single frequency is possible because ionosphere effects are negligible at such high frequencies (proportionality to the inverse of the squared frequency). The main advantage of this higher frequency (Ka versus classical Ku/C altimeters) is the reduced altimeter footprint that leads to a better spatial resolution. The added advantage of AltiKa is due to its enhanced bandwidth (500 MHz), which leads to higher vertical resolution. Thus, globally, an error budget improvement is expected. However, Ka-band has also drawbacks, mainly linked to its higher sensitivity to rainy and cloudy conditions. The altimeter antenna is a fixed offset paraboloid (1 meter diameter) and directed toward nadir of the satellite. It will be located on the top of the satellite.

Dual frequency microwave radiometer The bi-frequency (23.8 GHz / 37 GHz) radiometer is used to correct altimetry measurements from wet troposphere crossing effects. The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary water vapor sensing channel, meaning higher water vapor concentrations will lead to larger 23.8 GHz brightness temperature values. The addition of the 37 GHz channel, which has less sensitivity to water vapor, facilitate the removal of the contributions from cloud liquid water, which also act to increase the 23.8 GHz brightness temperature. The antenna, shared with the altimeter, is fed by a two frequency coaxial corrugated horn feed. A corrugated cold sky horn is used for the gain calibration of the 2 radiometer channels.
