Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) channels could account for more than 99% of the OLR total variance. Comparison with the ERBE (Ellingson et al., 1994) instrument flown in NOAA 9–11 satellites suggested that estimates made with HIRS data exhibited errors of the same order as the estimated accuracy of ERBE (5 Wm-2), where as use of AVHRR data exhibits monthly bias of -1 to +2 Wm-2 and rms differences of about 14 Wm-2 (Gruber et al., 1994). Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 32 Geostationary satellite observations have also been used for OLR estimation. Schmetz and Liu (1988) and Cheruy et al. (1991) developed OLR retrieval technique using two channels (infrared window and water vapor) of Meteosat. Minnis et al. (1991) developed an algorithm to estimate OLR using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager window channels with additional water vapor information from analysis. Ba and Ellingson (2001) estimated OLR using several channels of the GOES sounder and presented comparisons with the CERES measurements. Ba et al. (2003) adapted the HIRS technique to GOES sounder and validated the derived OLR with collocated OLR measured from CERES onboard Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Terra satellites. Their results show instantaneous agreement within about 7 Wm-2. Singh et al. (2007) estimated OLR using the infrared window and water vapor channels radiances from Kalpana. Objective To develop the algorithm for estimating OLR from narrow band radiances from WV (6.5 – 7.1 µm), TIR-1 (10.3 – 11.3 µm) and TIR-2 (11.5 – 12.5 µm) channels of INSAT-3D imager. Algorithm is developed using two basic approaches: i. First approach (ALG-1) uses RTM simulated INSAT-3D radiances and OLR ii. Second approach (ALG-2) uses simultaneously measured CERES OLR and INSAT- 3D radiances 3.3 Inputs 3.3.1 Image and pre-processing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Gray count
