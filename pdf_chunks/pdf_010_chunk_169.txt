future scope. 9.2.1 Overview and Background Smoke is a form of particulate matter, which contains liquid or solid particles of the size ranging from 1−200µm. It is formed by combustion or other chemical processes. Each year more than 100 million tons of smoke aerosols are released into the atmosphere as a result of biomass burning. More than 80percent of this burning is in the tropical regions [1]. Smoke plumes can travel over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers horizontally and also reach up to stratosphere under certain atmospheric circulation conditions. Thus smoke can have an impact far beyond the region of fire activity. Smoke play a major role on the radiation balance of the earth-atmosphere system. Smoke particles scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation, thereby having a two-fold impact, i.e. a cooling effect at the surface, but warming effect on the atmosphere. Since the magnitude of the scattering effect outweighs that of absorption, smoke has a net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere-surface system. This is often called the direct effect of smoke aerosols [1]. Smoke can also modify the short wave reflective properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei [2]. Under a limited supply of water vapor, an increased number of nuclei result in smaller cloud droplets that have higher reflectivity than larger cloud droplets .This effect called the indirect radiative forcing, is difficult to quantify and has large uncertainties associated with the sign and magnitudes. Understanding such numerous and complex effects of smoke on weather and climate requires a good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of smoke and its optical properties, which is only feasible by means of satellite observation.
