Whether or not heavy precipitation and flash floods will occur are generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the mesoscale, infrared (10.7 m and 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring, intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, movement, and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine how much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three hours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal data sets used in this diagnosis. Large scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale precipitation are also known to have a close relationship
