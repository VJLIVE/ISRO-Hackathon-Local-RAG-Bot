imager observations which are available at nominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir. The averaging over a Field of Regard (FOR) of 9x9 pixels is used to enhance the signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels is higher in comparison to clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed radiances/brightness temperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties. For each 9x9 pixel box cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount is retrieved using Infrared window channel method or water vapor - window intercept method. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 103 Generally, window method does not give accurate retrievals over semi-transparent thin high clouds, therefore, water vapor - window intercept method is used over those FOR. 9.5.2. Infrared Window Channel (WIN) method In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. However, for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager at present only Infrared window observations are used in this method. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. 9.5.3. Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O) Cloud top pressure derived with this method are based on the fact that radiances from two different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of regard at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud radiances.     
