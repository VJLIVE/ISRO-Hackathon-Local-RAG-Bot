earth. By using H instead of Z, one can use g = 9.8 ms-2, a constant value in calculations. In reality, g decreases slightly with altitude. Difference between Z and H can be as much as 16m at the height of 10 km above sea level depending on pressure, temperature and humidity profile. Error in Z depends on error in retrieved temperature, specific humidity profiles as well as the surface pressure from analysis. Assuming pressure estimates are error free, a 0.5 K error in estimation of layer mean virtual temperature results in about 10 meter error in Z. Thus the error in Z is very much dependent on the uncertainties in the retrieved temperature and specific humidity profiles (Roland Stull, 2000). 1.4.2 Operational Implementation Once temperature and humidity profiles are available from surface and all 40 standard pressure levels, Z can be estimated from the formula described in the previous section. Layer mean virtual temperature (between pressure levels p1 and p2) may be estimated by using the formula ) 2 .1 ( log ). 2 (log ). 1 (log 10 2 10 1 10 p p T p T p T v v v   Where p1, p2 are pressure levels (p2<p1), Tv1, Tv2 are virtual temperatures at p1 and p2 respectively.
