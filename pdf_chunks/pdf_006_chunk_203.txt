In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 3). The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex number j i j i c j i v i u V , , ,   . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image- pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height). Fig 3: A schematic diagram of quality control process. Here X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector differences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as   t j i c t j i dif V V V , , , ,   . Here c V represents the current vector at (i, j) point and  t j i V , , neighborhood vectors with 1 1 , 1 1       j i
