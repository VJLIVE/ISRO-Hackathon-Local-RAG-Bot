over some, but not all, surfaces. This difference is useful for separating thin cirrus and cloud free condition and is relatively insensitive to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere (Hutchison and Hardy 1995). This test is executed over land at night. The three thresholds for MODIS algorithm are 15, 10, and 5 K, for low confidence, mid-point, and high confidence, respectively. Over snow-covered surfaces, the thresholds are 4.50, 4.00, and 3.50K. We shall be using only the high confidence thresholds. NIGHT OCEAN SPATIAL VARIABILITY TEST The standard deviation of 3x3 arrays of 11 μm brightness temperatures centered on the pixels of interest is calculated for ocean scenes at night. The clear-sky ocean surface is usually very uniform over regions of this size and, in general, the presence of clouds increases the variability. The thresholds for MODIS algorithm are 0.2K, 0.1K, and 0.05K for low, mid- point, and high confidences, respectively. The reader will note that these values are very restrictive, yet some very uniform low clouds are not detected by this test. For INSAT, we are using threshold of 0.05 K. If the Standard deviation  in 3 x 3 array of BT11 is less 0.05 then the pixel is a clear sky pixel. If  < 0.05 then cloudflag = 0 for the center pixel. SPATIAL UNIFORMITY TEST The previous test is applied only over the ocean. Spatial Uniformity test is applied to all pixels. The standard deviation , Tmean and Tmaxmean of the 3 x 3 array for the 11 μm brightness temperatures centerd on the pixel of interest is computed. If the | Tmaxmean - Tmean | ≤ 2.0 and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 0. Over Land , If (Tmean - Tmaxmean ) ≤ –12.0 K and 
