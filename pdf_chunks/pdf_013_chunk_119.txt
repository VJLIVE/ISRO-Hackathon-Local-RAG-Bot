of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as the guess fields. After retrieving the value of cloud top pressure effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is computed using eq (3) ABB = D(E)DFG(E) H[E,K(LF)]DFG(E) (3) where N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, NO the effective cloud amount,  is the window channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to window channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 105 9.5.4. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure The value of cloud top height, cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager is derived corresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager. These values are again derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the temperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential height formulae is used to compute cloud height for given temperature profile. Geopotential height (GPH) is then given by Z R Z R GPH o o   Where Ro = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. For given pressure, temperature and humidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any pressure level or thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level can be computed using the formula ) ln( P P g T R Z s v d  Ps – Surface Pressure, P – Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, vT - Layer mean virtual temperature.
