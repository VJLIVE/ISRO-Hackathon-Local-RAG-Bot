significant wave height and wind speed, based on empirical fits (Labroue [2004]). Nevertheless all these works are done for Ku and C band so at the beginning of the mission, the SSB will be estimated at 3.5% of SWH and an empirical model will be computed using at least one year of SARAL/AltiKa data.

Introduction : Rain & Cloud effect on SARAL/Altika Ka-band is highly sensitive to rainy and cloudy conditions. It means that an overall assessment of rain effect on SARAL/AltiKa data availability and quality should be performed during the verification phase in order to monitor global percentage and spatio-temporal evolution of lost data due to rain and cloud effect, and thus give a consolidated budget for data loss due to rain attenuation and waveform distortion. Attenuation by rain is expected to be much more significant at Ka-band than Ku-band, although even in the tropics, actual data loss is only expected to be 5-10% (Tournadre et al., 2009). However, the reliable detection and flagging of rain-contaminated data is important for the quality of the overall altimeter product. 5.7.2. SARAL/AltiKa Trailing edge variation flag Due to the mono-frequency characteristic of the SARAL/AltiKa altimeter, the rain flags used for T/P and Jason-1&2 altimeters can not be used as they rely on the differential attenuation by rain of the signal at Ku and C band. Furthermore, the use of Ka band implies that not only rain can significantly alter the altimeter measurement but also dense cloud, that is why we prefer using “trailing edge variation effect” instead of “rain effect”. A new “trailing edge variation flag” based on the analysis of the along-track variation of the off- nadir angle estimate (the so-called “Matching Pursuit”
