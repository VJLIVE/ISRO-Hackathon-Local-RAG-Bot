the version letter “T” in the name of the data products. This “T” calibration/validation version will be extensively validated by PIs during the verification phase. The current product version adopts models and standards that are consistent with version “d” of the Jason-1 and Jason-2 (I)GDR products (see RD 1). The table below summarizes the models and standards that are adopted in this version of the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs. Model Product Version "T” and “d” Orbit Based on Doris on-board navigator solution for OGDRS. DORIS tracking data for IGDRs DORIS+SLR tracking data for GDRs. Altimeter Retracking “Ocean” retracking MLE4 fit from 2nd order Brown analytical model : MLE4 simultaneously retrieves the 4 parameters that can be inverted from the altimeter SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 37 Model Product Version "T” and “d” waveforms: - Epoch (tracker range offset) ⇒ altimeter range - Composite Sigma ⇒ SWH - Amplitude ⇒ Sigma0 - Square of mispointing angle “Ice 1” retracking Geometrical analysis of the altimeter waveforms, which retrieves the following parameters: - Epoch (tracker range offset) ⇒ altimeter range - Amplitude ⇒ Sigma0 “Ice 2” retracking The aim of the ice2 retracking algorithm is to make the measured waveform coincide with a return power model, according to Least Square estimators. Retrieval of the following parameters: - Epoch ⇒ altimeter range - Width of the leading edge - Amplitude ⇒ Sigma0 - Slope of the logarithm of the waveform at the trailing edge ⇒ Mispointing angle - the thermal noise level (to be removed from the waveform samples) “Sea Ice” retracking In this algorithm, waveform parameterisation based on peak threshold retracking is applied to the Ka-band waveform. From this parameterisation, a tracking offset and backscatter estimate are determined. Tests are made on the extent of the tracking offset, and
