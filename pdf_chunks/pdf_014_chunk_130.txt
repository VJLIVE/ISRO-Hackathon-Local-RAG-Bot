scattering by clouds or atmosphere which is very valid assumptions for clear atmosphere and opaque clouds at the desired sounder spectral bands. Now expanding above equations by integrating by parts and solving we get: Uab(Q, ST) = UTVW(Q) −∫ c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)] _b Lh Le gd ------------------- (6) Now by substituting Eq (6) in Eq (3) we get: U(Q) −UTVW(Q) = NO ∫ c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)] _b Le Lh gd ------------------- (7) This is the basic equation used in CO2 slicing method. It is evident from the Eq (7) that with the help of a-priori information of UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d), value of S that is cloud top pressure could be inferred. However, even with this a-priori information, there are two unknowns (NO and S) in Eq (7). To solve this problem, the ratio of Eq (7) for two observations made in nearby spectral bands is taken. Thus radiance ratios between two spectral bands in similar frequencies (Chahine, 1974; Smith and Platt, 1978) gives the information of cloud top pressure. The ratio of the deviations in observed radiances, R() to their corresponding clear-sky radiances, UTVW(Q) for two spectral bands of frequency Q and Q viewing the same FOV is written as D(Ei)DFGj(Ei) D(Ek)DFGj(Ek) = lmi ∫ n(Ei,b)o [pi,q(r)] or e h _b lmk ∫ n(Ek,b)o [pk,q(r)] or e h _b ------------------- (8) As it is already stated that channels with wavenumber (or wavelength) that are very similar in wavenumber (wavelength) are taken to satisfy the assumption that cloud emissivities in both channels are same that is O is approximately equal to O. With this assumption we are left with only one unknown in Eq (8) and that can be easily estimated. After retrieving the value of cloud top pressure using a-priori information of UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d) in eq (8),
