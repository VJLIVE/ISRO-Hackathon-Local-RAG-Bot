The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5°x 0.5° to 2°x 2° degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 184 rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an hourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would be required on routine basis, preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5°x0.5° grids. Pre-launch Field Experiments Pre-launch validation campaign were launched earlier for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A based rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D, 3DR. A three months period will be selected (mainly rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain gauges and the algorithm will be tested. Post-Launch Special Field Experiments Many of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented for the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be utilized for the INSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the validation campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual consultation with IMD. 15.7. Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges): To merge in situ rainfall data from the AWS rain gauges with INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall estimates, one of the simplest and state-of-the-art techniques, called the successive correction method (Cressman, 1959; Thiebaux and Pedder, 1987) has been found suitable enough for objective analysis,. It involves the successive modification of satellite rainfall estimates based on observed rain gauge rainfall data. The objective analysis scheme benefits
