Step-2 Compute the theoretical albedo â from ageo and ADM For each cloud category ( 1 to 4): â (Iscn, ’) = amod (Iscn, ’) + Fc [ageo(Colat, Lon). ( ’ ) - amod (Ngeo, ’)] ---(6) where Fc is related to the cloud fraction, and has been defined above in the ‘night time’ section It is easy to check: â (Iscn, ’) = amod (Iscn, ’) for overcast â (Iscn, ’) = ageo(Colat, Lon). ( ’ ) for clear sky Step-3 Compute the theoretical SW radiance LSW LSW = [ (Iscn, ’, ’, ’) â (Iscn, ’)] (E0 cos(’) /  ---(7) where  is the anisotropic bi-directional factor Step-4 Compute the theoretical LW radiance LLW Similarly as in the night-time section LLW = [ R (Iscn, ’, Colat) .
