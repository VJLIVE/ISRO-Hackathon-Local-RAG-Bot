atmosphere at a depth below the sensor that is of the order of the absorption length. Thus for bigger absorption coefficient, the absorption length is smaller and hence the temperature signal is received from higher altitude. So by making observations at a number of wavelengths near a broad absorption line, different altitudes in the atmosphere can be investigated. Thermal infrared temperature profilers normally employ the broad and deep CO2 lines near 15 m wavelengths. Radiative transfer equation in the non-scattering case may be written in simple form as: Where,  -Surface emissivity τ(p0) -Vertical transmittance from level with pressure p to space T(p) -vertical profile of temperature and B[T(p)] -corresponding Planck function profile. This equation implies that the radiance received at a particular wavelength is sum of three terms on the right hand side: first term is upwelling radiance from the surface, second term is direct atmospheric emission term and the third term is reflected downward atmospheric emission reaching at satellite sensor. (/p) is called a weighting function. It weights the Planck function in the atmospheric component of the emitted radiation. It specifies the layer from which the radiation emitted to space originates, and hence it determines the region of the atmosphere that can be sensed from space at this wavelength. Fig.1 shows the transmittance profiles and corresponding weighting functions at three wavelengths for which the atmospheric absorption is different. Since the weighting function is the derivative of the transmittance profile, it will peak higher in the atmosphere for the wavelengths at which the absorption is stronger. In this way, if the atmosphere is observed at a number of carefully chosen wavelengths, whose weighting functions sample the atmosphere, then it is possible to retrieve the Planck’s function Bλ(T) and thereby the temperature T itself. To explain this form of weighting
