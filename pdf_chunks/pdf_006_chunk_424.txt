(10-20°) and high (40-70°) levels of solar zenith angles (Figure 5a). Figure 4.

Sensitivity of the clear-sky insolation model to aerosol optical depth There was substantial and similar trend of decrease in both global (15-20%) and direct (25-30%) instantaneous insolation for a given range of AOD500 (0.05 to 0.6), but the gap between direct and global is reduced at higher solar zenith angle. The steepness of slopes of direct insolation was more negative (-0.67 Wm-2) than global insolation (-0.35 Wm-2). The slopes were less negative (-0.48 Wm-2, -0.35 Wm-2) at higher solar zenith angle for both the cases. Diffuse insolation, in general, showed gradual increase with increase in AOD500 but it reached plateau at higher solar zenith angle with AOD500 beyond 0.2. Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 352 Diffuse fraction was found to show sharp increase between 0.12 to 0.28 and 0.18 to 0.38 at low (17.46) and high (41.1) solar zenith angles with increase in AOD500 between 0.1 to 0.6. But the higher diffuse fraction was noticed at higher solar zenith angles for similar AOD500. It was found that there was practically little decrease (3-7%) in global, direct and diffuse insolation with increase in water vapour between 1.5 to 6.5 cm (Figure 5b). The decrease was still less for ozone (Figure 5c) varying between 240 to 290 dobson units. Figure 5b.
