of atmospheric pressure. Between the estimated water vapor point and the surface (or, the lowest altitude at which a’ priori P and T are available), temperature is assumed to vary as a quadratic function of natural logarithm of P (denoted by σ) i.e. T (σ) = a + b*σ + c*σ2. We have T and σ at water vapor point, where the dry temperature and pressure are approximated as actual temperature and pressure and the surface (known from meteorological observations or reanalysis of Numerical weather prediction models like ECMWF or NCEP), giving two equations for the temperature quadratic i.e., 2 ) ( s s s c b a T       (11) Where s  is the natural logarithm of surface pressure. 2 ) ( wv wv wv c b a T       (12) Where wv  is the natural logarithm of pressure at the water vapor point.

Solving equations (11) to (13), one obtains the three coefficients for the temperature quadratic. Once a first estimate of temperature quadratic is made, temperature profile in the first iteration is evaluated using dry pressure and water vapor pressure is calculated using the equation 5 2 10 73 . 3 6 . 77    PT N T e (14) Once a first estimate of e is made water
