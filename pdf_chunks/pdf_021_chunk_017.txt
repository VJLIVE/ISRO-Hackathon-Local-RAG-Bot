parcel becomes negatively buoyant and tends to return to the LNB. Assuming adiabatic ascent, i.e., no mixing of environmental air, we can determine the LNB for given sounding. Conventionally, the e and es are determined considering 1000 mb as the reference level. We find that by taking 1000 mb as reference the convergence of thermodynamic equations above hilly terrain is not always possible, and thereby it does not allow us to carry out correction for warm rain over such regions. Taking cognition of the fact that 1000 mb is not a realistic level over hilly terrain where surface pressure is often much lower. We thus replaced this 1000 mb with surface temperature over hilly terrain in thermodynamic equations for e and es. This resulted in more often convergence of equations over hilly terrains. Figure 11 (a) shows the EL/LNB as computed using 1000 mb as reference surface and Fig. 11 (b) shows the EL/LNB as computed with modified algorithm. One can notice the changes only over some regions (especially, Himalayas, Hindukush and Arabia) where with modified scheme the computation of LNB is now possible.

The 850 mb level is considered for avoiding the boundary layer for surface pressure close to 1000 mb level. For high orographic regions, this needs to be modified and replaced with realistic level. This is done in the modified algorithm; we can see the 850 mb u-wind component on a typical date and time in Fig. 12 (a), and modified wind input to orographic correction in Fig. 12
