for the convective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and b are varied as per precipitable water (PW) provided by Eta model. This allows higher precipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained such a way that it yields a value of 0.5 mm h-1 of rain rate at 240 K, and a precipitable water (from Eta model) dependent value at 210 K of Tb10.7. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain value at any pixel is limited depending upon availability of PW. This allows the maximum precipitation to become a function of available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm h-1 is given as 40 times the precipitable water in inches. If a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In principle, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity. Foa a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb10.7 and Rs is given as: Rs=(250-Tb10.7) * (Rmax/5) -----------------(2) Rmax is again a function of PW. The relationship between Rmax and PW is not known in this case and needs to be determined. Rs is not allowed to exceed - corresponding convective rain rate (Rc) or 12 mm h-1, whichever is lower. The relationship between Eta model derived PW and R (in mm h-1) at 210 K is shown in figure 1(a). The figures 1 (b) and 1(c) shows the relationship between R and Tb10.7 at different PW values for convective and non-convective cores, respectively. These figures are taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowaski et al. (2003). In H-E
