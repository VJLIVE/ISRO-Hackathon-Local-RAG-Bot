During this period rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal temporal profile of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount of deviation during April. This may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop and was only captured in computed ETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. The temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 to 30 mm in January with gradual rise in February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due to rise in temperature and Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 327 radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the estimates. The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with respect to AMS. The central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at Powarkheda site. The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo always remained
