depends on latitude and season. The ADM are not continuous functions of the angles, but discrete values corresponding to the angular intervals. Table-2 ERBE 12-Scene types No. Scene Type Cloud Fraction (%) 1 Clear Ocean 0-5 2 Clear Land 0-5 3 Clear snow/ice 0-5 4 Clear Desert 0-5 5 Coastal 0-5 6 Partly cloudy ocean 5-50 7 Partly cloudy land 5-50 8 Partly cloudy coastal 5-50 9 Mostly cloudy ocean 50-95 10 Mostly cloudy Land 50-95 11 Mostly cloudy coastal 50-95 12 Overcast 95-100 In the following, subscript Mod stands for Modelled (ADM). R is the LW anisotropy function  is the SW anisotropic function (bidirectional reflection) The LW ADM contains: 1. Flux Mmod (Iscn, Colat) 2. Anisotropy function R (Iscn, ’, Colat) 3. Standard-deviation of radiances in the corresponding angular bin  (Iscn, ’, Colat) The SW ADM contains: 1. Albedo amod (Iscn, ’) 2. SW anisotropy function  (Iscn, ’, ’, ’) 3. Standard-deviation of radiances  (Iscn, ’, ’, ’) 4. The LW-SW correlation coefficient Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 58 Here Iscn = scene Colat = colatitude ’ = view zenith angle (VZA) ’ = solar zenith angle (SZA) ’ = relative azimuth (RA) Instead of using amod it is practical to define the angular dependence of the albedo:  (Iscn, ’) = amod (Iscn, ’)/ amod (Iscn, ’=0) Where the denominator is the ‘overhead’ albedo or albedo for sun at zenith 5.2.1.2.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimator From the ADM tables, the modelled radiances with their associated standard deviations can be easily calculated for the four cloud categories. In the LW/SW graph (Figure-1), the centre of the ellipse represents the average SW-LW radiances and the areas describe the standard deviation. The cloud fraction of a measurement is determined by its location on this plane. For each ScaRaB measured
