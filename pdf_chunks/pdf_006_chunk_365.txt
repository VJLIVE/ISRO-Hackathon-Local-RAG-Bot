up to 35 degree by the INSAT-3D Imager (figure 2), we expect to obtain overall modeling error less than 1 K. 18.5.3 Application of LST algorithm to INSAT-3D Imager data A total of 40 raw images of INSAT-3D Imager sensor for every half an hour time period of 29th Nov. 2013 were obtained for the analysis. From the raw h5 images, the top-of- atmosphere (TOA) radiance data corresponding to two split-window channels (TIR1 and TIR2) and latitude-longitude layers were extracted from it. The TOA radiance data were converted to the brightness temperature values using the calibration coefficients provided in form of look-up-table. Then these brightness temperature layers of two split-window channels were geo-referenced using the latitude and longitude datasets. An example of Imager standard false colour composite for a daytime (05:30 GMT) is shown in the figure 9. Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 295 Figure 9. Image composite generated from INSAT-3D Imager data using the combination of TIR1, TIR1 and TIR2 channels for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) Now the TOA brightness temperature images corresponding to the split-window channels were converted into the LST values using the SWC and proposed method. Here a particular set of SWC was used in the SW algorithm depending upon a VZA sub-range, i.e. a unique set of SWC was applied for each of the seven VZA sub-ranges. Figure 10 shows an example of LST image generated by the proposed method. The LST image shown here has been generated by the SW method along with the known emissivity values generated over India with the help of approximately 20 emissivity tiles of MODIS. The LST products have been generated with a typical spatial resolution of 4 km. A specific land-sea mask was applied to obtain only the landmass covered within the image. The
