Gohil Revised inversion technique for humidity profile 4.2 Introduction The Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite is designed to study the impact of water cycle on atmospheric climate processes and energy exchanges over the Tropics. Megha-Tropiques was launched into a circular 867-kilometer orbit inclined at 20 degrees to the equatorial plane on 12th October 2011. From this orbit; the satellite is able to collect frequent data over the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone to complement and augment those obtained by satellites in geostationary and polar orbits. The MT satellite payloads are high-technology sensors viz. Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS), a millimeter wave humidity profiler (SAPHIR), an optical-IR radiometer for radiation budget (ScaRAB) and a radio occultation sensor (GPS-ROS). All the sensors have been integrated with IRS platform and primarily developed under ISRO-CNES joint collaboration. 4.2.1 Overview and background: The Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie (SAPHIR) instrument is developed by IPSL and Observatoire de Paris as part of the MEGHA-TROPIQUES payload to study the vertical distribution of water vapour in the tropical troposphere, with two specific objectives: 1. Analysis of the diurnal cycle of the water vapour distribution, to evaluate the vertical transports associated with
