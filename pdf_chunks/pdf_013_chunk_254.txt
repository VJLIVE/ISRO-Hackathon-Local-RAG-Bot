rise in February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due to rise in temperature and radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the estimates. The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with respect to AMS. The central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at Powarkheda site. The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo always remained high as compared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After that, estimated ETo underestimated measured ETo. In January, both showed low values in the range of 30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm (estimated) in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 mm over ten days (16.6% deviation from AMS mean). The typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented here by Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and February. The data over monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for computation of ETo. In this part INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 221 of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well captured by dekadal ETo variation during stated months. During July, ETo remained higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ETo showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to AMS. The temporal profile
