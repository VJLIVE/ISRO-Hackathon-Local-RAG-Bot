starts in July and it was well captured by dekadal ETo variation during stated months. During July, ETo remained higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ETo showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to AMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD of 6.3 mm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo. The southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural scrub vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used for comparison with AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The difference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon season (January to February) but later on, the difference was reduced further in May and November. The data showed a RMSD of 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS mean). The island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions as compared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so climatic condition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and August to November were used for comparison. The AMS ETo on an average had a range of 23 to 50 mm throughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was observed for estimated ETo. The dekadal behaviour of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed little higher deviation during August and September. It showed RMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean).
