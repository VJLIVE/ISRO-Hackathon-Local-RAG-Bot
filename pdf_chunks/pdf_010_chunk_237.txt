from geo- stationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. WVWV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. 12.8 References 1.
