generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 13.4.2 Operational Implementation 13.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image  Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window. 13.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment  Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height. Visible wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 208  Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above. 13.4.2.3 Step 3: Tracking  The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. 13.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of
