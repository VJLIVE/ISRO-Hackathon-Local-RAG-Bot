Data Resolution Source UTH EUMETSAT Humidity Profile Radiosonde observations IMD Humidity Profile 1 X 1 deg NCEP Reanalysis Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 240 15.6.2 Methods of validation Radiosonde profiles and NCEP analysis profiles of water vapour are converted into upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) estimates using water vapour channel weighting function of the satellite concerned. UTH is weighted average of relative humidity weighted by the water vapour weighting function at each atmospheric level. These estimates of observed UTH are compared with the collocated satellite retrieved UTH. These estimates of UTH can also be compared with retrieved product of Meteosat satellite located over Indian Ocean region. Because the extracted UTH product is dependent on the WV channel calibration, these UTH/radiosonde comparisons may also provide a method of checking the actual WV calibration coefficients. Brightness temperature observations of satellite WV channels may also be used with simulated brightness temperature from collocated radiosonde profile to compute the bias correction coefficients in the RT model. 15.7 Technical issues ( limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the satellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. i) It is assumed that upper tropospheric temperature does not deviate by a large amount from the mean monthly profile. ii) Satellite receives only a negligible amount of radiance emitted from layers beneath 600 hPa. The atmosphere above 200 hPa is represented by decreasing the relative humidity to 0% at 100 hPa, which seems to be a reasonable assumption consistent with the structure of standard profiles and observations. iii) The reason for using mean monthly profiles of water vapour at lower levels as input to the radiative transfer model is that these levels contribute very little to the outgoing
