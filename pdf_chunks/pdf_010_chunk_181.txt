Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited to one (GOES) or two channels (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) were used first to derive the total aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model. The relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the look up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed Aerosols INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 156 reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information on the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the corrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical thickness. The approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required for aerosol optical depth retrieval. A near-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated pixels, then the surface reflectance in the visible bands is calculated from the observed reflectance in the near-IR band. The optical thickness is initially calculated assuming a continental aerosol model. The suspended matter information is used to choose a better
