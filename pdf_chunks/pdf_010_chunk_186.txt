thereby reducing the surface reflectance. The second darkest observation will be used in the composite clear reflectance (CCR) method to reduce the effect of cloud shadows. By selecting the second darkest pixel, a cloud shadow would need to be present on at least two days during the period to affect the composite. The accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For instance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the surface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be likely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric component remains large in such situations. Atmospheric effects—aerosol extinction, Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption — will be removed from the composite using the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. This will retrieve the surface reflectance, sfc. Some aerosols are still present in the composite reflectance; their radiative effect must be removed as well. This aerosol will be simulated using rural and dust aerosol model, given its ability to simulate the aerosol signal over the Indian region. This will represent the aerosol extinction still present in a composite reflectance. The amount of background aerosol is difficult to determine because it varies with season, length of CCR and time of day. However, it has been reported that background aerosol can vary from 0.02 to 0.08. Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval The aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using a INSAT-3D imager visible image and the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the optical depth of the rural and dust model in the 6S radiative transfer model is increased until the theoretical reflectance matches that in the INSAT-3D imager observation. The second simulation (6S) model
