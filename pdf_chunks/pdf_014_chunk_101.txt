ratio and to make observation less correlated. Data assimilation warrants very accurate, and uncorrelated observations. CSBT product is aimed towards providing observations. 7.5.2. Generation of CSBT As it is evident from the name of parameter, CSBT is generated for clear sky pixels. Since this product is mainly used in NWP data assimilation, it is re-gridded at coarser resolution of 0.50x0.50 grid. This helps in reducing noise in value in BT as well as creating uncorrelated observations. Generation of CSBT involves following steps: 7.5.3. Preparation of latitude-longitude grid INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are orbiting in geostationary orbit and are located at 83.0 0E and 74 0E, respectively. Therefore, the geographical extent of observed area by both the satellites is different particularly in east-west direction. As both the satellites are in geostationary orbit, thus in principle, the viewing location of each pixel does not vary for different acquisitions. Based on the fixed grid of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, a latitude-longitude equal grid is selected and all further processing in done the same grid. For INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: Min Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325 Min Longitude = 1.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325 For INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: Min Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325 Min Longitude = -3.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325 7.5.4. Averaging of parameters A simple box average method is adopted to generate parameters. CSBT, satellite zenith angle and solar zenith angle and land fraction (for a given grid) are generated. In data assimilation, satellite and solar zenith angles and land fraction are required along with CSBT. As already stated that CSBT is calculated for clear pixels only, therefore, for averaging operational cloud mask product is also used. INSAT-3D/3DR
