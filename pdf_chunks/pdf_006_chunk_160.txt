systems. The fire products will include an identification of the occurrence of thermal anomalies, and an estimate the total emitted Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 132 energy from the fire. The products will be made available at full resolution (4 km) and as spatial summaries and temporal composites. Daytime and nighttime fire distributions products will be identified. The fire products will be developed on the basis of convergence of evidence from different spectral information. The INSAT-3D fire products will provide information on the location of a fire, its emitted energy, and an estimate of area burned. The fire products will be made available through IMD as daily 4 km resolution and spatially and temporally summarized products (10 km, and 8 day and monthly), more suited for use by the broader environmental management community as well as modelling community. 8.2.2 Objective The basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying fire using INSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time application of INSAT 3D data in the identification of fire. 8.3 Inputs Inputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced radiant temperature (in deg Kelvin) for MIR,TIR-I,TIR-II, along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). Additionally there is a requirement for temperature data from all IMD-stations, which will help in defining thresholds. Cloud and land/sea mask data will also be used. All these inputs are specifically categorised in the following subsections: 8.3.1 Static Data About 10 years temperature data from all IMD-stations (as stated in table below), interpolated to geo-referenced raster format (GeoTIFF) at 4x4 km spatial resolution for entire India. This will be useful in defining the background temperature for different temperature zones. Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Temperature Pixel (4x4 km spatial resolution)
