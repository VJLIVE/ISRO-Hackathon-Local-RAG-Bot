Methods of validation The evaluation of CMV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures. Quantitative assessment of the CMV product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to the report. a. Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. b. Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor motion vectors through the last 12 months. c. Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde report used for verification is given by (VD) = [ (Ui – Ur)2 + (Vi – Vr)2 ]1/2 The speed bias is given by The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is N (BIAS)i = 1/N ∑ [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ] i=1 N (MVD) = 1/N
