550km wide, located on each side of the satellite track, separated by a nadir gap of 700 km. For operational generation of AWV products, L2B data (with 25 km resolution) of ASCAT provided by EUMETSATâ€™s broadcast system for environmental data (EUMETCAST) are being used. In order to construct global synoptic wind fields from the along track wind observations (e.g. wind vector and wind stress), spatial interpolation of the missing data grids is performed. In our study, we have used interpolation algorithm based on simple eight grid averaging technique, known as box averaging interpolation. If the growth of wind field over oceans is assumed to be stochastic, the predicted value for a missing grid can be fairly specified by the average of surrounding eight grids with equal weights. This method is comparatively fast and can be used operationally for all regions and all seasons. This box averaging technique is physically applicable only on the scalar spatial functions. Hence, first of all, we have prepared gridded data for each of the two (zonal and meridional) components of the wind vectors and wind stress. Then the missing grids over global oceans are filled up using the above averaging technique. This method iteratively fills up all the missing data grids on global scale. If the number of iterations increases after an optimal value, the accuracy in the resultant product decreases. Being a very simple iterative interpolation technique, box-averaging method fills up all the missing data grids on NRT basis. The method is tested for high gradient of wind fields (e.g. tropical cyclones) and found to produce satisfactory results. The gridded wind fields are computed in near real time with a delay of 24 hours for daily winds and 12hours for 12hourly winds. Every product also contains a log file for the quality of analysed
