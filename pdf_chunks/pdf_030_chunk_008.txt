summarized in equation 11 to 15. We have assumed that the absorption due to CDOM dominates over detritus absorption. We also corrected for the CDOM slope bias by introducing empirically derived expression for S (Fig. 3), details are presented in Section II-D. We also accounted for the variability in a∗ph using its dependence on chlorophyll (Bricaud et al., 1995). This whole formulation led to a significant improvement in the retrieval outcome. Fig. 3. Relation between CDOM slope “S” (1/nm) and CDOM absorption coefficient ag at 443 nm was established based on the combined data set of NOMAD and Indian coastal data. rrs() = C1 [𝑏𝑤(𝜆)/ (a+𝑏𝑏)] + C2 [𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆)/ (a+𝑏𝑏)] C1=0.l13 C2 = 0.197 [1 - 0.636 * exp(-2.552 (𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆) / (a+𝑏𝑏)))] (11) 𝑎(𝜆) = 𝑎𝑤(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑝ℎ(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑔(𝜆) (12) 𝑎𝑔(𝜆) = 𝑎𝑔(𝜆0)exp (−𝑆(𝜆−𝜆0)) (13) Sg = 0.0099ag-0.226 (14) 𝑎𝑝ℎ ∗(𝜆) = 𝐴(𝜆)𝑐ℎ𝑙−𝐵(𝜆) (15) In ABOM, if a few changes in parameterizations are carried out then the same becomes ABOM2 as A relationship between the integrated response of the coloured dissolved organic matter(CDOM) and detritus i.e. ag+ad and ad for global dataset was carried out as shown in the following plot: ag+ad = 2.2389ad0.7555 (16) The integrated slope of cdom and detritus for global waters was observed as 0.016±0.0025. [23] S = 0.016 (17) 4.3.1 Model for the Slope of CDOM Absorption The empirical relation for CDOM slope was estimated using the extensively calibrated and enhanced in situ bio-optical NOMAD (NASA Bio-optical Marine algorithm data version 2.0 ALPHA) data set. Based on bathymetric information, all optical data corresponding to locations falling within 50-m depth zone, classically defined as case-2 waters, were extracted from NOMAD. The data points from NOMAD were filtered on the basis of finite values of available optical parameters like water leaving radiance (Lw), surface solar irradiance
