of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean region (Deb et al., 2008). 12.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control Quality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the coherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and quality control procedure is proposed and implemented first time
