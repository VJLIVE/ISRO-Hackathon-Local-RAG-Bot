by DP team. In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured radiance into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite. Step 2: Tracer selection from image  Read first two registered images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR.  Choose the tracer box in the first image (i.e. 3D) and calibrate the similar tracer box from 3DR from second image into 3D equivalent.  Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window. Step 3: Height assignment  For height assignment use brightness temperature from single satellite (i.e either 3D or 3DR) to avoid height inaccuracies due to inter-calibration of two satellites.  Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.  Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers.  Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above.  Height optimization using minimized differences with first guess. Step 4: Tracking  Before tracking the tracer selected from first image in the second image, bigger tracking area in the second image is calibrated with respect to the first image.  The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 156 Step 5: Wind buffer generation &
