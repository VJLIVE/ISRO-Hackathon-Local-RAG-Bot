Deb, C.M. Kishtawal Mid-Infrared winds Baseline Document (Version 1) 14.2 Introduction The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Mid-Infrared Winds (MIR) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D will have one MIR channel (3.8 – 4.0 m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived winds from mid-infrared channels characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 14.2.1 Overview and background Spatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of geostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed time interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the cloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies and spatio–temporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio–temporal life cycle includes the generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of geostationary satellite images. During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, cloud motion winds were produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service)
