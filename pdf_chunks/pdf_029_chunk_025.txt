techniques in metropolitan cities. In figure 8, the AOD map, fine mode fraction map, and AOD histogram are shown for data acquired by OCM-2 over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January 2021. The particle size distribution function from AERONET data at Bhola station, Bangladesh is also shown in figure 8 for the same date. A very thick layer of aerosol (heavy air pollution, AOD>1.0) over IGP is observed. The AERONET stations located at Dhaka University and Bhola, Bangladesh show very high AOD values of 1.5 and 1.25, respectively. OCM-2 AOD retrieval is consistent with ground observations. A fine mode fraction map shows high fine aerosols in the entire IGP, while relatively coarser-sized particles in central India are observed. It is well known that during winterâ€™s high anthropogenic pollution associated with the biomass/biofuel combustion process occurs over IGP giving rise to fine aerosols. The dominance of fine mode aerosol is also verified by size distribution observations at AERONET stations Dhaka University and Bhola. 6.3.2 Validation results with AERONET data As described previously the retrieved products must look reasonable, and must be evaluated about ground-truth data. The test data includes the entire 2016 data i.e., almost around 1092 L1B datasets were processed to generate the aerosol product. Out of these 180 individual granules corresponding to path-9, row-13 (during the entire year of 2016) enclosing four AERONET stations namely Kanpur, Jaipur, Gual Pahari (India), and Karachi (Pakistan) are used for validation with ground truth. Among these, 3 stations, are interior urban centers and mainly affected by anthropogenic sources of aerosols. Over Karachi, being a coastal city, the aerosols are also affected by marine sources (sea salt) in addition to anthropogenic sources. The results are shown in figure 9. A very good correlation, of around 0.8 is observed. About 63%
