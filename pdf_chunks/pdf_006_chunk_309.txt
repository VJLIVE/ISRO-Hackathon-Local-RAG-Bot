Î»i. For each channel, we can write a radiative transfer equation (excluding reflection term): This equation expresses the forward problem for the channel, i.e. given the state of the atmosphere; the solution of this equation gives us the radiance incident at the satellite in this channel. Using the radiances measured by the satellite radiometers, we can determine some information directly. For well-mixed gases such CO2, we assume that the mixing ratio is known and independent of height. Wavelengths that are sensitive to these gases are used to retrieve atmospheric temperature. For wavelengths sensitive to variable trace gases, such as water vapor and O3, we assume that the temperature profile is known and use the radiances to retrieve mixing ratios. Unfortunately, no wavelengths are completely free of absorption by the variable trace gases; this contributes to errors in retrieving temperatures. Also, errors in our knowledge of temperature profiles lead to errors in trace-gas retrievals. The above equations are strictly applicable only at a single wavelength, but satellite instruments sense a band of wavelengths. So the equation must be integrated over wavelength using the spectral response function for each channel as a weight. This can be very time-consuming. To overcome this problem, regression based fast transmittance models are formulated, in which the atmosphere is divided into predetermined layers, and the transmittance of each layer, averaged over the response function of the radiometer is calculated. Then the functions of temperature, humidity and zenith angle are fitted to the results to generate regression coefficients for the fast model. The inverse problem: Inverse problem in the satellite meteorology is to obtain the state of the atmosphere (in terms of its vertical profiles of temperature and constituents) from the radiance measurements. Since we have a limited number of channels the inversion of equation is ill posed
