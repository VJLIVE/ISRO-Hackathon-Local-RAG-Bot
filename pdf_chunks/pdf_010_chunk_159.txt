area in Assam and Gujarat, 93% in Arunachal Pradesh, 67% in Bihar, 69% in Himanchal Pradesh, 46 % in Jammu and Kashmir, 45% in Karnataka, 76% in Madhya Pradesh, 94% in Meghalaya and Orissa, 87% in Nagaland, 58% in Uttar Pradesh and 33% in W. Bengal is subject to annual fires. One of the most important critical elements of the forest fire management system (FFMS) in the country is the real time detection onset of fire and it’s monitoring; study the rate, direction and quantitative estimation of fire spread and amount of smoke emission. Satellite data with suitable spectral bands for fire detection (Visible, SWIR, MIR and Thermal IR bands), daily or twice a day’s repetivity (day and night) and bare minimum spatial resolution, which can locate the fire, can play an important role in development of country’s FFMS. Geostationary satellite such as GOES with automated biomass burning algorithm (ABBA) have matured enough for providing information on large-scale forest fires on a regular basis (Prins et al, 1992, 1994, 1998). INSAT-3D imager data with 1 km resolution in Visible and SWIR bands and 4 km. in MIR and in TIR-I and TIR-II will help in detecting and monitoring of large scale forest fires, smoke and burn scar. The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving forest fire areas from INSAT-3D multi-wavelength thermal radiation measurements in clear skies. The INSAT-3D fire products will be built on the experience of fire assessment using the MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR and GOES systems. The fire products will include an identification of the occurrence of thermal anomalies, and an estimate the total emitted Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 132 energy from the fire. The products will be made available at full resolution (4 km) and as spatial summaries and temporal composites. Daytime
