longwave in clear sky and cloudy sky. For net shortwave in clear and cloudy sky albedo and for net longwave clear sky LST sensitivity will be evaluated. For cloudy sky, weather forecast based air temperature and humidity along with INSAT derived OLR sensitivity will be done in future. The high resolution (3 Km) and high temporal (1-hour) weather forecast from IMD for evaluation of the surface temperature, relative humidity will also be used simultaneously with MOSDAC weather forecast to develop algorithm followed by sensitivity analysis. Figure 1 . Flow chart of algorithm for estimation of net radiation (Rn) over land INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 71 5.4.4. Steps for operational implementation The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of net radiation over land (Rn) product generation: viii) The hourly temperature and humidity data at 2-meter surface height from forecast from WRF (ASCII format) at 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid. ix) Conversion of all ASCII outputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 0.04o X 0.04o grid resolution as per the INSAT 3D insolation product x) The sub setting of LST, albedo and insolation products as per the bounds of Asia sector products. xi) Integration of INSAT derived insolation, albedo, LST with 2-D surface of WRF variables in to physical model to generate clear sky net radiation (Rn). xii) Integration of INSAT derived cloud mask and insolation in to empirical model to generate cloudy sky net radiation (Rn). xiii) The clear and cloudy sky net radiation at each hour will be used to generate hourly net radiation (Rn) over Indian land mass. xiv) The average of 24-hours net radiation will be used for generation of daily net radiation (Rndly). The pre-condition for generation of Rndly is that there will no consecutive two- hour
