the potential fire pixel and its “background” pixels (the definition of background varies according to kernel size). As opposed to the fixed threshold techniques, which must be defined for given regions and seasons, the contextual algorithm is supposed to be flexible and effective in different environmental conditions. Potential fire pixels will be identified using a less restrictive version of the threshold algorithm. These threshold values will be determined through visual inspection of known fire/non-fire pixels. An initial threshold reduces the number of candidate pixels to be applied to the contextual algorithm. The contextual algorithm is based on detecting the contrast between a pixel and its background. A pixel’s background can be defined as the 15x15 window surrounding the subject pixel. Because of the large areal extent of many interior Indian wildfires, it is necessary to have such a large window size to define the background values. If a background window size is too small (for example, 3x3), there is a good chance that large wildfires occupying several pixels will elevate the background values rendering the fire undetectable. The algorithm is a three-step process: First, the temperatures of channels 3, 5, & 6 of INSAT-3D from pixels adjacent to the test pixel will be averaged; these values will be utilized in a separate algorithm to estimate background temperature and adjusted temperature values for channels 3 & 5. Second, a user-defined minimum fire temperature of interest will be specified. Third, if the adjusted temperature value for channel 3 is greater than the threshold channel 3 temperature, the pixel is classified as fire.
