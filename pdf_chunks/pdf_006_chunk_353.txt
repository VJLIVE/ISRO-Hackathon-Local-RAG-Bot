B   (2) with c1 and c2 being the Planck’s radiation constants, with values of 1.19104.108 W.m4.m-2.sr-1 and 14387.7 m.K, respectively. Inverting Eq. (1) we get, In this problem, the surface temperature is basically coupled with two factors: the surface emissivity and the atmospheric absorptions. Developing an LST algorithm means to find a solution of decoupling the emissivity and the atmospheric absorption effects from the satellite measured radiance. The surface temperature Ts can be obtained from Eq. 1 and 2 by correcting the atmospheric and emissivity effects and then by calculating Ts by inversion of the Planck’s law. However, atmospheric correction of TIR radiances is the most difficult part (Liang, 2004). The use of SW algorithm avoids the atmospheric correction issue. This method uses two thermal bands typically located in the atmospheric window between 10.5-12.5 m. The basis of the technique is that the radiance attenuation for atmospheric absorption is proportional to the radiance difference of simultaneous measurements at two different wavelengths, each subject to different amounts of atmospheric absorption. Actually SW algorithm provides atmospheric correction of a brightness temperature measurement in one spectral band (typically cantered around 11 m) given a brightness temperature measurement in a second “spectrally-close” band (typically cantered around 12 m) (figure 3). They exploit the differential absorption tendency of two neighbouring spectral bands due to various gases. To estimate LST from satellite observations, most SW algorithms are derived from a first-order Taylor-series linearization of the RT equation in long-wave infrared spectral bands (Yu, 2009).
