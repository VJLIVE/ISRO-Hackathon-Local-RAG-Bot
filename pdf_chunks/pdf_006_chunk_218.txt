The vertical distribution of WVWV is dependent on several key factors: 1) characteristics of the spectral channel, such as central wavelength and band width; 2) air-mass characteristics, such as cloudiness and vertical moisture profile; 3) season (less moisture in the cool season leads to lower mean heights); and 4) latitude (higher moisture content and tropopause in the tropics leads to higher mean heights). In regard to the first point, the operational geo-stationary weather satellites with water vapor channels (GOES, Meteosat, and GMS) have similar features. The coverage attainable from WVWV is quite uniform in most cases, since the observed displacement Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 185 of a large portion of the targeted features is a result of pure moisture advection and adequately represents the instantaneous wind. The coverage is especially complete in the
