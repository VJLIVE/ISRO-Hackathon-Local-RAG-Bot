GPs over oceans. The scheme is based on developing step-by-step procedures for transforming MADRAS based scattering index (SI) to equivalent SSM/I based scattering index with high accuracy (Varma et al., 2011). Ferraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. (1996) provided a rain identification and retrieval algorithm over land and oceans. Their algorithm is based on empirical relationship between rain rate and scattering index which is originally proposed by Grody (1991). The Ferraro and Mark (1995) algorithm is developed for SSM/I channels and is not directly portable to MADRAS which is having different sensor characteristics. According to Grody (1991), scattering index (SI) is defined as depression in the SSM/I 85 GHz V polarized Tb (Tb85V) due to scattering in the presence of rain. They calculated the depression by taking the difference between observed rain-affected Tb85V and its expected value (Fs) Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 35 under rain free conditions. The expected Tb85V (Fs) under rain free conditions is worked out by establishing a relationship between SSM/I Tbs at 85.5 GHz V and at 19.35 GHz V & H and 22.23 GHz V channels that are essentially emission channels and are considered not to be affected by scattering. The relationship that they proposed for scattering index (SI) is as follows: SI = Fs â€“ TbiV, where, TbiV is Tb from high frequency 85.5 GHz V polarized SSM/I channel, and Fs is expected TbiV under rain free conditions. The Fs is defined as, Fs= a1*Tb1+a2*Tb2+a3*Tb3+a0 These coefficients for SSM/I and MADRAS are calculated using radiative transfer simulated database of brightness temperatures under raining and non-raining conditions. This is shown schematically in Fig. 2 below.
