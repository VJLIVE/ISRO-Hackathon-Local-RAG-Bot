have been converted to the 34 level MODTRAN inputs by using directly the TIGR levels from the surface to 300 hPa (15 levels), sampling every 4 levels above 300 hPa (5 levels are excluded this way) and removing the upper 9 levels. -In addition to the profiles of temperature and water vapor of TIGR, mixed gases profiles from MODTRAN standard atmospheres have been added according to the time and location of each radiosounding. -No aerosols have been considered. -Satellite zenith angles: 4 values of the secant have been retained: 1., 1.5, 1.75, 2. This sampling aims to detect possible non linearities in the dependance of any given quantity in function of sec(). -Surface temperatures: For each radio sounding 3 surface temperatures have been assigned: Ta1000 (1000 mb air temperature), Ta1000+1C, Ta1000-1C. -Radiances have been simulated for INSAT-3A and INSAT-3D thermal channels (i.e. 10.5-12.5 m, 10.3-11.3 m, 11.5-12.5 m, 3.7-4.1 m) with emissivity values calculated from the tables of Masuda 1988 with a moderate wind speed of 5 ms-1 (see table 1 below). They have been calculated for each channel as means of tabulated values at the central and neighbouring wavelengths to account for the width of the filter function. For instance, emissivities for channels centred on 11 m were calculated as the mean Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 91 values of emissivities at 10.5 and 11 m, etc. They were then interpolated in function of sec() and used with a step of 0.0025 induced. Radiances will be integrated for each channel with the filter functions provided by Sensor Group and converted into radiative temperatures. The simulations applied on the "tropical maritime" subset of TIGR produced 5820 cases. Before being used to derive algorithms, the simulated radiative temperatures were filtered. To keep the simulated temperatures within realistic limits,
