(ship routing, environmental hazards, support to maritime industries). Also worth mentioning is the importance of wave and wind data provided by altimeter systems over oceans. This information is routinely used in meteorological and research entities, either for calibration of other data sets, assimilation in weather and wave models, or for statistical analysis. 2.2. Introduction to SARAL/AltiKa mission 2.2.1. Mission overview The SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. In the present document, we focus on the AltiKa part of the overall SARAL mission. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 8 SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter
