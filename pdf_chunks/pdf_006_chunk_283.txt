Shukla Shivani Shah UTH Baseline Document 15.2 Introduction Upper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) is an estimate of the mean relative humidity of the atmosphere between approximately 600 hPa and 300 hPa. UTH is basically a measure of weighted mean of relative humidity according to the weighting function of the water vapour channel. Therefore, UTH is more likely a representative of the relative humidity around the atmospheric layer where weighting function of water vapour channel peaks 15.2.1 Overview and background Upper tropospheric humidity from satellite measurements is useful to monitor changes in water vapour in the upper troposphere on a global and regional scale. Several methods have been developed for retrieving UTH from water vapour channel measurements (Schmetz and Turpeinen, 1988; Soden and Bretherton, 1993, 1996; Stephens et al, 1996). Changes in relative humidity around this layer would contribute maximum to the changes in the radiances received in this channel. UTH extraction is in principle the calculation of single-column values for the upper tropospheric humidity. The physics involved is the quantitative description of the transfer of the WV channel radiances from the radiation emitting surface through the atmosphere towards the satellite as calculated by radiative transfer model. The transfer calculations are performed for a set of different constant humidity values for the upper tropospheric atmosphere for standard atmosphere representing different months/seasons. Empirical coefficients generated for different months are then used to derive from the IR and
