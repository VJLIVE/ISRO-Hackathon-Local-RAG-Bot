2015 37 training data (Sample I). The GA training provides empirical equations (INSAT-3D as well as FY-2D) relating OLR to narrowband radiances and satellite zenith angle. The root mean square error (rmse) on the training data is about 7 Wm-2. The developed algorithm was applied on the Sample-II data in order to compute the OLR. The computed OLR for Sample- II data was compared with observed OLR and the root mean square error (rmse) was computed. The root mean square error (rmse) is about 9 Wm-2 (about 3 %) for both FY-2D and INSAT-3D. 3.4.1.4 Genetic algorithm Modeling natural phenomena has been a standard practice in atmospheric sciences. Traditionally, modeling a physical system requires one to derive the relevant equations from first principles taking into account the physical laws that determine the system under consideration. Alternatively, when such an approach is not feasible due to some reasons, e.g., the perfect physics of the system is not well understood, or the required computing resources are not available, empirical laws governing the physical processes can be obtained by model- fitting approaches based on the observed variability of the system and its relationship with other parameters. Let us assume that there exists a smooth mapping function P(.) that explains the relationship between a predicted variable x and a set of dependent variables [a,b,c,d,e,…], so that x = P [a,b,c,d,e, ……..] (6) In various areas of geophysics, it is a standard practice to employ linear or nonlinear regression techniques in order to obtain the form of P(.). However, the choice of a regression model is quite subjective, and it is difficult to ensure that a particular regression model provides the best possible explanation to the variance in a data set. This has inspired the researchers to look for more objective data fitting approaches like
