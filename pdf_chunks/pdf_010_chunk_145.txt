A grouped-criteria technique incorporating a NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm will be used due to the following reasons: 1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat. Its accuracy has been tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared from other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps using MODIS data. 2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as Himalayas. 3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 ÔÅ≠m with 1 km spatial resolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km resolution. 4) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the product is generated. Snow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 120 many other surface
