estimate CSBT over 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR) along with statistical parameters and a confidence flag that will help in using CSBT value in DA process. CSBT product is calculated for only clear pixels identified by INSAT-3D/3DR imager cloud mask (CMK) product. The algorithm has no limitation based on geographical location, therefore, can be applied to generate products over full disk or sector products. Nevertheless, the CSBT product is generated from only full disk product. 7.4. Inputs 7.4.1. Image and preprocessing data (dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of split window IR channel (10.5- 11.5 m and 11.5-12.5 m) and WV channel (6.7 m) All the data is required in fixed lat-lon grid. pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Cloud Mask pixel Operational L2 product Geo-location file Pixel - 4 Km Derived by DP 7.5. Algorithm Functional Specifications 7.5.1. Overview The clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is intended to be generated at 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR). CSBT product is generated at much coarser resolution than the actual resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at nominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir for TIR-1, TIR-2, MIR and ~8 km for water vapor. The gridding (averaging) over all pixels within 0.50x0.50 FOR. This averaging is done to enhance the signal to INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 88 noise ratio and to make observation less correlated. Data assimilation warrants very accurate, and uncorrelated observations. CSBT product is aimed towards providing observations. 7.5.2. Generation of CSBT As it is evident from the name of parameter, CSBT is generated for clear sky pixels. Since this product is mainly used in NWP
