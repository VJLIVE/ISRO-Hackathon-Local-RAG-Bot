linear interpolation from two adjacent integer values are performed. (b) Once the step 1 is completed, based on probability associated with all 6 channels we find average probability of rain as PRR and probability of no-rain as PNR. We then normalize them to get probability of rain (PR) and probability of no- rain (PN) as follows: NR RR NR N NR RR RR R P R P P P R P P     A pixel is considered as rainy if PR> 0.63 over land and > 0.6 over oceans. (c) Once a pixel is identified as rainy, we calculate rain from Equ. (1). The coefficients a, b and c are different for each pixel locations and surface type (land/ocean). The coasts are considered having maritime atmosphere. We have generated a static dataset of coefficients in which each row has a set of coefficients which represents the pixel location. For land a is found to be zero. A flow-chart of these procedures a provided in Fig. 11. 5. Format of the output and the domain The output is made available in the form of geolocation (latitude-longitude) and rain rate in mm h-1. The domain is global tropics within SAPHIR coverage area over land and oceans. 6. Expected Accuracy The achieved accuracy of instantaneous rain retrieval with respect to TRMM-PR is 0.91 mm/h. On monthly scale, expected rmse with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 is ~0.1 mm/h. 12 7. Conclusion and Future Scope Though SAPHIR is not specifically designed for rain estimation, yet it is shown for its use for rain identification as well as for rain estimation. The best instrument on MT for rain estimation is MADRAS but it has already been declared as non-operational due to problem with its scanning mechanism. In the absence of MADRAS observations,
