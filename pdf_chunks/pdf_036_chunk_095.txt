Table 15 - Dimensions used in the SARAL/AltiKa data sets 6.1.2.2. Variables Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of values of the same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a data type, and a shape described by its list of dimensions specified when the variable is created. A variable may also have associated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after the variable is created. A variable data type is one of a small set of netCDF types. In this document the variable types will be represent as follows: Variable type Description char characters byte 8-bit data signed short 16-bit signed integer int 32-bit signed integer float IEEE single precision floating point (32 bits) double IEEE double precision floating point (64 bits) Table 16 - netCDF variable type SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 64 6.1.2.3. Coordinate variables and auxiliary coordinate variables A variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate variable. It typically defines a physical coordinate corresponding to that dimension. In accordance with the Climate and Forecast conventions, we must declare a coordinate variable for each dimension. Whatâ€™s more, missing values are not allowed in coordinate variables and they must be strictly monotonic. An auxiliary coordinate variable is a netCDF variable that contains coordinates data but is not a coordinate variable as defined above. Unlike coordinate variables, there is no relationship between the name of an auxiliary coordinate variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s). 6.1.2.4. Attributes NetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary data or metadata), similar in many ways to the information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional
