methods are based on the SI, PCT and D approaches mentioned above section which are highly applicable for the rainfall retrievals. In order to demonstrate the applicability of empirical approaches, the existing data of TRMM radar and radiometric observations will be utilized and compared with the standard TRMM products of rainfall. The Fig. 3 shows the Logical Flow of Algorithm Development and Validation diagram to be used conceptually.

An inversion procedure, however, is needed to find a rainfall rate, R, given a brightness temperature Tb. The double valued nature of the relations is encountered in 19 to 37 GHz channels as is shown in sensitivity section; however it could be resolved by a combination of two or more channels. Since Tbs are sensitive to the vertical structure of precipitation, the vertical structure cannot be ignored when instantaneous retrievals are sought. The sensitivity to the assumed profile gets larger as the frequency increases and the scattering in the upper layers of the cloud begin to play a larger role. The objective of the instantaneous rainfall algorithm over ocean is to be achieved using one of the suitable retrieval techniques, such as ANN, MR or Bayesian approach. Predefined cloud structures, however, may be utilized to overcome the uncertainties in the accuracies of the retrievals. Cloud resolving models such as the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE), which is a cloud microphysical model developed mainly by Tao and Simpson, (1993), or the Tripoli, (1992), model are used to supply the required cloud structures. For each cloud model time step,
