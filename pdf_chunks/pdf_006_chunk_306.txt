wavelengths at which the absorption is stronger. In this way, if the atmosphere is observed at a number of carefully chosen wavelengths, whose weighting functions sample the atmosphere, then it is possible to retrieve the Planck’s function Bλ(T) and thereby the temperature T itself. To explain this form of weighting functions, we consider the emission to space from air parcels of unit volume at different heights in the atmosphere. The radiation emitted to space is determined by three factors: temperature of the air parcel, number density of emitting gas, and transmittance of the atmosphere from the air parcel to space. For the lowest parcel, the atmospheric density is high and so the amount of radiation emitted is high, but most of the radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere above it and very little reaches space. For the highest parcel, the transmittance to space is high, but comparatively little radiation is emitted because )1( .) ( )]. ( [ ). 0 ( ). 1( .) 0 ( )]. ( [ ) 0 ( ).

These two contrasting effects combine in such a way that, at some intermediate height, the contribution of a parcel to the radiation reaching space is a maximum.
