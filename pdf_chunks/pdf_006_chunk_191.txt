Deb CMV Baseline Document (Verson 3) 11.2 Introduction The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D will have two IR window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5- 12.5 m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived CMV and INSAT-3D IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. 11.2.1 Overview and background Spatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical weather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a
