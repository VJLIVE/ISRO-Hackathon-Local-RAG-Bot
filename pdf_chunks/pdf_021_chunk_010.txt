rain from INSAT-3D and from 3B41RT. The 3B41RT is microwave based hourly rain rates. Fig.1: Rain rate in (mm/h) on 23 Sep. 2013 at 1200 UTC from (a) INSAT-3D by SAC, (b) GMS by NOAA and (c) TRMM 3B41RT. Despite of having good agreement over most of the regions, the rain over the Himalayan region is not well picked up by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as from Meteosat. This issue is dealt in modified H-E that is described in the later part of this report. Figure 2 show another example of INSAT-3D derived instantaneous H-E rain associated with Phaillin cyclone from 10 â€“ 13 Oct. 2013. The Fig. 2 (a) to (h) shows the development to decay of the cyclone in chronological order. The intense rain associated with eye-wall as well as spiral clouds bands of the cyclone is clearly seen. The H-E also very well picked up the eye of the cyclone as rain-free area. The distribution as well as the intensity of the H-E rain associated with cyclone is found to be in agreement with the observed history of the cyclone (Anonymous, 2014). The cyclone made a landfall on 12 Oct. 2013 at around 1530 UTC and caused intense rain in Orissa during 12-14 Oct 2013. The Figure 3 show the district averaged rain rate from H-E and a network of rain gauges from the state government of Orissa. A good agreement can be observed in rain distribution from H-E and surface observations. A scatter plot of H-E rain and surface observations from Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4.
