convert the instrument measured radiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite.  It is important that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly different parts of H2O absorption band. Sampling the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from the upper levels of the troposphere, similarly sampling away from the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of the atmosphere 12.4.2.2 Step 2: Tracer selection from image  Water-vapor images tracer selection will be done by evaluating local image anomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window exceeding some thresholds value. 12.4.2.3 Step 3: Height assignment  Assign height of the selected tracer using water vapor histogram technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.  Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above. 12.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking  The tracking employs a simple search for the minimum in the sum of squares of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. 12.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the
