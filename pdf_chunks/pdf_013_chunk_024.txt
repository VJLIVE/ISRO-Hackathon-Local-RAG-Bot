Algorithm Specification Version Date Modified by Description 1.0 June 2018 C. P. Singh Biomass Burning Emission Product 2.2. Introduction Near-real-time estimates of biomass burning emissions are crucial for air quality monitoring. This algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) provides a description of new fire characterization science product, specifically named as, biomass burning emission product (BBEP) utilizing the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager. The INSAT active fire algorithm is a dynamic multispectral thresholding contextual algorithm that is based on the sensitivity of the 3.9 μm (MIR channel) to high temperature sub-pixel anomalies relative to the less sensitive 10.8 μm (TIR-1 Channel). The current operational version of the INSAT fire product provides information on the location of the fire pixel only.
