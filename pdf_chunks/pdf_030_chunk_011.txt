when CDOM is high. In GSM model, the slope value of CDOM absorption is kept constant and high (0.02 nm−1) which also creates a strong bias resulting in overestimation of chlorophyll concentration. The ABOM model accounts for the low magnitude in slope values for higher CDOM absorption in optically complex waters. Although the power function for CDOM slope is able to explain only 24%–25% variability in the data set, incorporation of this equation in ABOM is able to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of chlorophyll concentration when combined with the model for phytoplankton specific absorption [9]. The model can be further improved by incorporating the contribution by detrital absorption at reference wavelength. 4.5 Discussion and Validation on ABOM2 The performance of the global models was illustrated in Table 2 for deriving absorption coefficients due to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated response at 443nm. The limitation of the Lee-Morel-Bricaud model and GSM model is to derive the integrated response of CDOM and detritus only with 33% and 30% uncertainty respectively. However, the above limitation was partially solved using [22] i.e. the model is capable to derive the absorption coefficient due to coloured dissolved organic matter at 443nm with 36% uncertainty in optically complex waters. While the new parameterized model is able to address the above described limitations of deriving absorption coefficients due to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated response at 443nm with 30%, 40% and 29% uncertainties respectively. In addition to that, Statistics of the performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag), detritus (ad) absorption coefficients and their integrated response at 443nm, have been illustrated in Table 3. The important point here is to note that the mean values of NASA bio optical marine algorithm datasets [NOMAD] for absorption due to
