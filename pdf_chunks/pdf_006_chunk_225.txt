ten steps. These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. Once the water vapor tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. 12.4.1.1.3 Tracking: If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the Water vapor wind INSAT-3D
