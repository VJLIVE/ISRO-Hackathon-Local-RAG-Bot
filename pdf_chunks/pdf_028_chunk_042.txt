3.4 Objectives:  Development of Algorithms for the retrieval of Integrated Water Vapor, Cloud Liquid Water and Wind Speed over oceans from Mega-Tropiques MADRAS. 3.5 Inputs 3.5.1 Static Data We need following datasets for the retrieval of GPs. The datasets must represent global variability of the parameters.  Temperature profiles  Pressure Profiles  Relative Humidity profiles  Sea Surface Temperature  Surface Wind Speed We use the NCEP GFS reanalyzed model fields at 61 vertical levels with 500 m separation as input database for the RT model. 3.5.2 Dynamic Data Following geolocated datasets are required. Table -4 Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Tb 19 GHz V Standard swath data with same grid (cell) size for all Tbs 0.01o Standard dataset with predefined/proposed accuracy DP Tb 19 GHz H Tb 37 GHz V Tb 37 GHz H Tb 24GHz V 3.5.3: Other auxiliary data  Sensor error estimates from sensor group. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 33 3.6. Algorithm Functional Specifications: 3.6.1: Theoretical background Radiative Transfer Model The brightness temperature received by microwave radiometer looking towards earth in non-scattering atmosphere in a thermodynamic equilibrium is given by: Tb(,p) = TbDN () (1-(Ts, ,p)) +Ts (Ts, ,p) ()+TbUP Where, Tbν = brightness temperature measured at frequency ν TbDN = downwelling radiances TbUP = upwelling radiances = frequency of observation  = angle of incidence  = transmittance  = emissivity Ts = surface temperature p = polarization TbDN TbUP Surface Ts,  Tb TbS   Fig. 1 The total brightness temperature has three components as mentioned in expression above and also in Fig. 1. First, the emitted radiation by the atmosphere directly reaching to the radiometer which mainly depends upon the absorption by atmospheric constituents like dominantly absorbing gases (oxygen and water Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 34 vapor) and the hydrometeors
