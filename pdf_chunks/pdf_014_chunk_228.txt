Algorithm Functional Specifications 16.4.1. Overview 1.4.1.1 Theoretical Background In the thermal infrared spectral region and in the day time observations, thermal emission and solar reflection are in the same order of magnitude (Petitcolin & Vermote, 2002). Assuming cloud free atmosphere under local thermodynamic equilibrium, the sensor measured MIR radiance IMIR is given by the following equation (A.-L. Li et al., 2013): )1( ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , (                    sc at MIR R R R I Where, R is attenuated (by atmosphere) radiance from the ground (path 1 in the following figure), τ is the transmittance of the atmosphere. The second term on the right hand side, Rat↑ is the upward atmospheric thermal radiance (path 2 in the figure), and Rsc↑ Is the upward solar diffusion radiance resulting from atmospheric scattering of the solar radiance (path 3 of the figure). R can further be decomposed in the following equation (path 4 to 7 in the figure). ) 2 ( ) , ( ) cos( ) , , , ( )] , ( 1[ )] , ( 1[ ) ( ) , (
