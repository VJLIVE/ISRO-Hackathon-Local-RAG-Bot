1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by computing local image anomaly in a 24 x 24 template window (in pixel), both in cloudy regions of the visible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:    i j I j i I a ) , ( (1) Where  j i I , represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 138 13.4.2. Height assignment The height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also
