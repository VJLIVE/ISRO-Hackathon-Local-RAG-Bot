day of each month of the year 2015 using the method discussed in the above section. The broadband LSA was derived at a spatial resolution of 4 km over India and surrounding region. The broadband LSA maps for different months are shown in the figure 3. Visually the spatial patterns and magnitudes of broadband albedo look very reasonable. Majority of the broadband albedo values are in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 representing vegetation and soil pixels. However, desert regions show LSA value greater than 0.3 and ranged between 0.3 to 0.5. While snow covered regions show LSA value greater than 0.4 or 0.5. An error due to clouds still persists even though the cloud mask was applied on the images. Fringe of clouds are seen with very high albedo values, which causes an erroneous albedo value. A better mechanism for removing clouds has to be developed in future. The assumption of a Lambertian surface is being debated (Liang et al., 2003). The key argument is that the broadband albedo depends on both spectral and angular properties of the land surface. From the validation analysis of the study by Liang et al. (2003), it appeared that an assumption of spectral information dominance over the angular information does not lead to significant errors, which is an important achievement of this study. Overall it can be said that broadband LSA could be successfully computed over India from the INSAT-3D Imager observations. This is a preliminary study carried out for computing the broadband land surface albedo from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor, however detailed study is underway to establish the proposed method with more simulations involving additional land cover types. There is also a requirement to enhance the cloud removal technique, which will minimize the noise observed in the albedo retrieval. Moreover, issue related
