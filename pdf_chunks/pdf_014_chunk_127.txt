(CTP, CTT and effective cloud amount) is a combination of two methods: Window channel method and CO2 slicing method. Both of these methods require forecast fields of temperature and moisture. The CO2 slicing method requires the use of radiative transfer model. In this section physics of deriving cloud height and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations is discussed. This sections presents the conceptual framework of retrieval algorithm. 10.6. Physical Basis of the Cloud Top Pressure/Temperature/Height Algorithm 10.6.1. CO2 Slicing: Mid- to High-Level Clouds The assumptions made for the application of the CO2 -slicing algorithm are (Menzel et al., 1992): (i) the emissivity of the cloud is the same in all channels used, (ii) clouds occur as a single cloud layer, (iii) lower cloud layers are ignored, and (iv) the surface temperature and the temperature structure of the atmosphere and its transmittance at the used wavelengths are known. Retrieval of cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount (i.e., cloud fraction multiplied by cloud emittance) are performed using radiances measured in those spectral bands that are located within the broad 15 m CO2 absorption region. The CO2 slicing technique makes use of combination of 15 m CO2 absorption channels that have different opacity, therefore, sensing different layer of atmosphere. This helps in assigning height of clouds. The channels of INSAT-3D/3DR used in the cloud top pressure and amount algorithm are described in Table 1.
