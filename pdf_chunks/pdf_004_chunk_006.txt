so called 'triplets', 'quadruplets' or multiple of radar backscatter through a model known as Geophysical Model Function (GMF) which relates polarized backscatter with wind speed, wind direction and observational geometry. 3.0 Oceansat-2 scatterometer system: Oceansat-2 satellite in sun-synchronous orbit at 720 km altitude will carry a Ku- band microwave scatterometer (SCAT) and an Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM). The satellite will have two days repeat cycle with equator descending time around noon. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate the two beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of ~ 49° and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of ~ 57° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 Km for inner beam and 1840 Km for outer beam respectively. The inner beam is configured in horizontal polarization and the outer beam is configured to vertical polarization for both transmit and receive modes. The horizontal polarization is chosen for inner beam in order to alleviate the low backscatter value problem of horizontal polarization at lower wind speeds. This would ensure the reduction in the path loss due to the slant range and hence maintains an almost the same SNR for both the inner and outer 3 beams. Brief specifications of the scatterometer view geometry are provided in Table (1). Figure (1a) shows the viewing geometry of the scatterometer (SAC, 2005).

Due to circular scanning of two beams at fixed incidence angles, areas of a particular size cut across
