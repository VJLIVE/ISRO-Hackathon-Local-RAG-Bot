All of these sensors of foreign space agencies are equipped with the channels to measure radiances in several narrow visible, near Infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. In addition to measuring un-polarized spectral radiances at a single scattering angle, some of these sensors such as MISR and PARASOL can also measure un-polarized as well as polarized radiances at several scattering angles, thus providing more scope to improve the accuracy of AOD retrieval as well as aerosol optical properties. Most of these sensors utilize the dark-target method over dark vegetated surfaces and the deep-blue method over bright surfaces to retrieve AOD products. Both of these methods require spectral radiance measurement in at least three visible channels (near 440,490, 620 nm) and two SWIR channels (1.24 & 2.12 um) for aerosol retrieval in addition to channels required for masking unwanted target pixels. As far as Indian satellites are concerned, none of the existing sensors fulfils the requirements of measurement in all channels especially the SWIR channels, which is crucial for aerosol retrieval. Most of the spaceborne optical imaging sensors onboard different Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites such as OceanSat (1, 2 and upcoming 3), CARTOSAT (1, 2 and 3) and RESOURCESAT (1 and 2), etc. were designed for specific applications related to
