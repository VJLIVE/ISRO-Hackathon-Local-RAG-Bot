registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. a. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval N (∆U2) = ∑ (Ui –Ur)2 i=1 N (∆V2) = ∑ (Vi –Vr)2 i=1 (MCD) = [ (∆U2) + (∆V2) ]1/2 ≠ (MVD) INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 159 This sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity. b. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment We plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by IMD’s
