The purpose of this document is to present the methodology for deriving 5-day composite maps using Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D/3DR at different broad atmospheric levels. The out of six imager channels in INSAT-3D/3DR, AMVs are derived using four channels and they are: i) Visible (VIS) covering [0.55 – 0.75 µm], ii) Mid-wave Infrared (MIR) covering [3.8 – 4.0µm], iii) Water Vapor (WV) covering [6.5 – 7.1 µm] and iv) Thermal Infrared (TIR1) covering [10.2 – 11.3 µm] ranges of spectrum respectively. In this document some background and general characteristic of different AMV-derived products; the methodology employed to derive the 5-day composite maps are presented. 12.3. Overview and background The Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived by considering the movement of cloud and water vapour tracers in successive images of geostationary satellites (Nieman et al., 1997; Velden et al., 1997; Schmetz et al., 1993; Kishtawal et al. 2009) are considered as one of the most reliable source of wind information with higher spatial-temporal coverage over the ocean as well as land regions.The AMVs is one of the important inputs to the global and regional assimilation systems for the improvement of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The role of AMVs is particularly significant over the oceans and high latitudes where in-situ observations are scarce. The vertical coverage of AMVs spreads through high to low-levels as per the channel used during retrieval viz. AMV retrieved using: i) infrared channel data covers entire ranges of atmosphere i.e. from 100- 950 hPa, ii) water vapour channel data covers only high-level i.e. from 100-500 hPa, while iii) visible and mid-infrared channel data covers low-levels i.e. from 600-950 hPa respectively. 5-Day INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 131 composite winds maps derived using the retrieved AMVs in three broad atmospheric levels are very useful for monitoring of
