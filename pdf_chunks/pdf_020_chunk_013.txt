as MODIS. The basic inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where both sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter- comparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements. 10.7 Technical issues (Limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the satellite radiances. However, the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. (i) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study. Use of darkest observation for last 28 days provides mean reflectivity. This may also introduce significant errors in derived AOD, specially for the location with persistent AOD for long period. (ii) Due to single visible channel aerosol type is to be fixed which is in reality is not a good approximation. This may introduce large errors in retrieved AOD. (iii) Over bright surface and high aerosol loadings, TOA reflectance becomes insensitive to aerosol therefore; AOD over bright surfaces may have large uncertainty. 10.8 Future Scope In future algorithms making use of INSAT-3D/3DR imager data for SWIR and MIR bands can also be attempted for characterization of surface reflectivity. 10.9 References 1.
