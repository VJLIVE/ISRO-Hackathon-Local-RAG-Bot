similar to Fig. 7 except corresponding values over Himalayan region which are now have higher values compared to those in Fig. 7. We expect that this correction in TPW and RH will help getting more representative rain values from H-E. 5.1 Correction of Equilibrium Level / Level of Neutral Buoyancy Computation The Equilibrium Level (EL) or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops from IR measurements with that of EL. This level comes before tropopause for the warm rain. This adjustment was initially developed to enhance rainfall in regions where the convective EL was too low (in height) for very cold cloud tops to develop, but where very heavy precipitation is still possible. If equivalent potential temperature of the parcel is e and sateurated equivalent potential temperature of the environment is es, then usually a parcel begins with e <es of the environment. As the parcel rises, conserving e, it will eventually have a e equal to the es of the environment; this is referred as the level of free convection (LFC). As the parcel rises above the LFC, it is positively buoyant and will continue to raise until eventually e is equal to the es of the environment again, this is referred as EL or LNB. Above the LNB the parcel becomes negatively buoyant and tends to return to the LNB. Assuming adiabatic ascent, i.e., no mixing of environmental air, we can determine the LNB for given sounding. Conventionally, the e and es are determined considering 1000 mb as the reference level. We find that by taking 1000 mb as
