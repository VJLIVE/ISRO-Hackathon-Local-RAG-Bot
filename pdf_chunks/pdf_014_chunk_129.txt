pixel, the radiance observed, R(), in spectral band , can be written as: U(Q) = NUTV_ + (1 −N)UTVW ------------------- (1) Where U(Q) is observed radiance in band , N is the fractional cloud coverage, UTVW is radiance from clear portion and UTV_ is radiance from the cloud covered portion. Cloud covered radiance can be written as: UTV_ = OUab + (1 −O)UTVW ------------------- (2) Where O is the emissivity of cloud and Uab is radiance from the opaque cloud. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 114 By combining Eq (1) and Eq (2) we get: U(Q) = (1 −NO)UTVW(Q) + NOUab(Q) ------------------- (3) Now from radiative transfer equation UTV_ and UTVW are given as: UTV_ = P(S)c(S) −∫ c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)] _b Le f gd ------------------- (4) UTVW = P(S)c(S) −∫ c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)] _b Lh f gd ------------------- (5) Where S is the surface pressure, S is pressure corresponding to the top of single level cloud, c(Q, d) is the top of the atmosphere (p = 0) transmittance of radiation of spectral band  emitted from the atmospheric level at pressure p, and P[Q, R(d)] is the Planck radiance for spectral band for temperature T at pressure level p. Thus first terms of Eq (4) and (5) represents the contribution to radiance from the surface term (which is cloud top in Eq (4) and surface in Eq(5)), whereas, the second term represents the absorption of radiation by atmosphere above the surface or cloud top. These equations neglect the scattering by clouds or atmosphere which is very valid assumptions for clear atmosphere and opaque clouds at the desired sounder spectral bands. Now expanding above equations by integrating by parts and solving we get: Uab(Q, ST) = UTVW(Q) −∫ c(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)] _b Lh Le gd ------------------- (6) Now by
