Using this expression the isotropic component of the diffuse radiance I0 can be deduced following (Weinman and Davies, 1978) 2. Discrete Ordinate Approximations The radiative transfer equation 15 in terms of polarization p (H or V) can be expressed as (Tsang and Kong, 1977):                           1 1 )τ( B ) ω 1( 'μ d ) μ ,τ( I ) μ ,τ( I P P P P 2 ω ) μ ,τ( I ) μ ,τ( I ) μ ,τ( I ) μ ,τ( I τ d d μ 0 1 1 H V HH HV VH VV 0 H V H V (13) Where all the symbols have their usual meaning. Here Plank function B( is assumed to be linearly varying function of from the top of the layer (B0) to the bottom of the layer i.e., B(B0+B1he four scattering phase functions (PVV, PVH, PHV and PHH) are the ones integrated over all azimuthal directions. Thus there exists cross-polarization scattering in the scattering source term because PVH and PHV are not zero. The exact solution of Ip(is obtained by solving equation using the discrete ordinate method with sufficient streams. In this DOM model it is assumed that cross-polarization scattering in the scattering source term is negligible and the scattering phase function is assumed to follow Henyey- Greenstein equation, and is expended with Legendre polynomial (pl) as Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 15   
