clouds. Various researchers have tried to related cloud thickness with satellite observed brightness. The contradictory claims are made. Some of them have found high correlation between two, where as others could not notice so encouraging results with their studies. It is concluded that cloud brightness alone cannot always imply cloud thickness. In more than one instance, Erickson and Hubert (1961) found in their study that large thunderstorms having vertical depths of the order of 30000 feet appeared no brighter, than a rather dense overcast of much smaller vertical extent. The understanding of the factors governing cloud brightness is complicated as it is a problem of optics that again requires an excursion into the theory of electromagnetic radiation. The light scattering from water clouds can be described as a problem of effect of light scattering by particles of size comparable or slightly more than the wavelength of the incident light. For water clouds, the particles (or droplets) may vary in size (the number of particles as a function of their size), and the cloud geometry is variable (the arrangement of particles in relation to the incident beam of solar radiation). This problem is generally treated in two parts: single scattering and multiple scattering. The single scattering theory describes the fate of incident light in a very small part of a natural cloud. The aggregate effect on the incident beam of all parts of a cloud is treated through the theory of multiple scattering. Here, the dimensions of the cloud and its orientation with respect to a given incident beam become important. Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 72 Twomey et al. (1967) calculated reflectance as a function of geometric thickness for a cloud drop distribution of 6 m average radius and 1 m standard deviation. Liquid water content was
