to the difference between at-sensor radiances measured simultaneously in two different thermal channels. Many types of the SW algorithms have been developed for the LST retrieval. In an earlier analysis reported in a paper (Pandya et al., 2011b), various SW algorithms were evaluated for LST retrieval from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Ten different published SW algorithms (or their slight variants) from the literature were evaluated and compared in the study and the following suitable form of algorithm (Eq. 3) was selected for the Imager sensor.         d a a T T a T T a T a a T j i j i i s . 1 . . . . 6 5 2 4 3 2 1          This SW expression was then modified from the original formulation for having improved results for correcting path length variation due to high view zenith angle imaging in the case of Imager sensor from the geostationary orbit as described in the following sub-section. 18.4.1.2 Modification of split-window method: Correcting for Path Angle Variability As shown in figure 2, the Imager sensor has wide field of view. McClain et al. (1985) first pointed out that, at high viewing angles, atmospheric absorption is amplified. Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 289 Geometric analysis shows that the atmospheric path length at the sensor’s edge-of-scan (for view zenith angle ~65 degree) is at least 2.5 times higher than at nadir. Pandya et al. (2011a) have also shown that at-sensor radiance value observed by the Imager sensor reduces with increasing view zenith angle by an amount of 7 to 8 percent for 300 K target. This has a significant effect on the satellite measured brightness temperature. For a target on
