Layer Optical Depth algorithm (Hannon et al 1996). This model is very flexible and can take any number of pressure levels for forward model computation, however, internally it interpolates atmospheric profiles to fixed 43 pressure levels ranging from 1013 to 0.1 hPa. This interpolation is done because fast forward coefficients for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder SRFs are derived on given 43 pressure INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 116 levels. The forward calculations from RTTOV takes satellite zenith angle, absorption by well- mixed gases (including nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide), water vapor (including the water vapor continuum), and ozone into account. The forecast field from NCEP containing temperature, moisture profiles, surface air temperature, skin temperature etc. are used to simulate clear sky transmittances and radiances. The right hand side of Equation (8) uses aforementioned transmittance profiles. Integration is carried out by using trapzoidal method wherein integration limit is bounded by surface pressure and tropopause pressure level. For the retrieval of cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder a “top-down” approach, similar to MODIS cloud top pressure retrieval method is followed. In this approach pair of two channels are selected based on their decreasing opacity. If retrieval of cloud top pressure is successful for a given pair, then there will no need for applying eq (8) for other pair of channels which are relatively less opaque. For INSAT-3D/3DR sounder first pair of ch#2 and ch#3 are taken which are considered to be the most opaque channels for CO2 slicing method. If eq (8) appropriately converges for this pair, then retrieval is considered to be successful, otherwise the same procedure is repeated with pairs of (ch#3, ch#4) or (ch#4, ch#5). If none of these pairs are able to give value of cloud top pressure, then window channel method is used for retrieval of cloud top
