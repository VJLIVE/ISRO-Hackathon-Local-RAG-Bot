at 100 hPa, which seems to be a reasonable assumption consistent with the structure of standard profiles and observations. iii) The reason for using mean monthly profiles of water vapour at lower levels as input to the radiative transfer model is that these levels contribute very little to the outgoing radiance. 15.8 Future Scope These coefficients can be improved with the availability of more accurate radiation models in future. UTH algorithm in future may include the upper tropospheric mean temperature derived from model forecast to minimize the uncertainties due to the temperature variations in the 600-200 hPa layer. 15.9 References 1.
