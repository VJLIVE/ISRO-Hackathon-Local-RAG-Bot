Orbits, Revolutions, Passes, and Repeat Cycles An Orbit is one circuit of the earth by the satellite as measured from one ascending node crossing to the next. An ascending node occurs when the sub satellite point crosses the earth's equator going from south to north. A Revolution (REV) is synonymous with orbit. The OGDR data is organized into files (“segments”) which corresponds to the amount of data dumped over an Earth terminal (typically 2 hour-data sets). The (I)GDR data is organized into pass files in order to avoid having data boundaries in the middle of the oceans, as would happen if the data were organized by orbit. A Pass is half a revolution of the earth by the satellite from extreme latitude to the opposite extreme latitude. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 6 For SARAL/AltiKa, an Ascending Pass begins at the latitude -81.49 deg and ends at +81.49 deg. A Descending Pass is the opposite (+81.49 deg to -81.49 deg). The passes are numbered from 1 to 501 representing a full repeat cycle of the SARAL/AltiKa ground track. Ascending passes are odd numbered and descending passes are even numbered. After one repeat cycle of 501 passes, SARAL/AltiKa revisits the same ground-track within a margin of ±1 km. That means that every location along the SARAL/AltiKa ground-track is measured every approximately 35 days. 1.4.1.3. Reference Ellipsoid The Reference Ellipsoid is the first-order definition of the non-spherical shape of the Earth as an ellipsoid of revolution with equatorial radius of 6378.1363 kilometers and a flattening coefficient of 1/298.257 (same reference ellipsoid as used by the Jason-1, SARAL/AltiKa and the
