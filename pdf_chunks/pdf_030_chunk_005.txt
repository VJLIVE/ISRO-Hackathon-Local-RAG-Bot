Remote-sensing reflectance spectra (Rrs(λ)) measured during field data collection. Lake exchanges seawater with Lagoon making it optically complex system. Fig. 1 shows the map of study area with station locations used for collecting in situ data. Corresponding reflectance spectra is shown in Fig. 2. 4. Background and Methodology 4.1 Bio-Optical Inversion Model Gordon developed the first simplified analytical model in 1973 for ocean color applications. The model was based on the assumption that most of the scattering takes place in forward direction, and the color and shape of the upwelling light field are the consequences of absorption and single scattering at large angles (Gordon and Evans, 1993). Based on this assumption number of analytical models have been developed. The Rrs in water column is the function of total absorption coefficient and backscattering coefficients (Gordon et al., 1988; Morel 1988; Morel and Prieur 1977). The SA ocean color models by Gordon et al. 1988, Maritorena et al. 2002, and Garver and Siegel 1997 are described below through the following equations: 𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆, 𝜃, 𝜓) = 𝑡2 𝑛𝜔 2 ∑ 𝑔𝑖 2 𝑖=1 ( 𝑏𝑏(𝜆) 𝑏𝑏(𝜆)+𝑎(𝜆))𝑖 (1) 𝑎(𝜆) = 𝑎𝜔(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑝ℎ(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆) (2) bb(λ) = bbw(λ) + bbp(λ) (3) 𝑎𝑝ℎ(𝜆) = 𝐶ℎ𝑙 𝑎𝑝ℎ ∗(𝜆) (4) 𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆) = 𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆0)exp (−𝑆(𝜆−𝜆0)) (5) 𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆) = 𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆0) [ 𝜆0 𝜆] 𝜂 (6) 4.2 Solving the Model The above set of equations show that the Rrs is a function of six unknowns S, η, a∗ph(λ), chl, aCDM(λ0), and bbp(λ0). The vector θ = [chl,
