periods of 433 days (called the Chandler wobble) and annual. These periods are long enough for the pole tide displacement to be considered to be in equilibrium with the forcing centrifugal potential. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a single field for the radial geocentric pole tide displacement of the ocean surface (see pole_tide parameter), and includes the radial pole tide displacement of the solid Earth and the oceans. The pole tide is easily computed as described in Wahr [1985]. Modeling the pole tide requires knowledge of proportionality constants, the so-called Love numbers, and a time series of perturbations to the Earth's rotation axis, a quantity that is now measured routinely with space techniques. Note that the pole tide on the IGDR and GDR may differ, since the pole tide on the GDR is computed with a more accurate time series of the Earth's rotation axis. 5.10. Inverse Barometer Effect 5.10.1. Inverted Barometer Correction As atmospheric pressure increases and decreases, the sea surface tends to respond hydrostatically, falling or rising respectively. Generally, a 1-mbar increase in atmospheric pressure depresses the sea surface by about 1 cm. This effect is referred to as the inverse barometer (IB) effect. The instantaneous IB effect on sea surface height in millimeters (see parameter inv_bar_corr) is computed from the surface atmospheric pressure, Patm in mbar: inv_bar_corr = P) - (P -9.948 atm âˆ— where P is the time varying mean of the global surface atmospheric pressure over the oceans. The scale factor 9.948 is based on the empirical value [Wunsch, 1972] of the IB response at mid latitudes. Some researchers use other values. Note that the surface atmospheric pressure is also proportional to the dry tropospheric correction, and so the parameter inv_bar_corr approximately changes by 4 to 5 mm as model_dry_tropo_corr changes by 1 mm (assuming a
