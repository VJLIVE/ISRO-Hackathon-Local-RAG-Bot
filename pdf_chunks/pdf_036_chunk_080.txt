presence of free electrons in the Earth’s ionospheric layer. As the Total Electronic Content (TEC) is highly variable in time (diurnal, seasonal, solar cycle variations) and in space (latitude dependent), accurate measurement of the resulting delay requires generally fine sampling coincident with the radar measurements. The ionospheric dispersion being linear, the delay is usually computed by combining the dual-frequency measurements of the radar altimeter (e.g. for T/P, Jason-1 and 2 : Ku and C bands). In the case of AltiKa, only one frequency is available (Ka), which prevents from using such a classical dual frequency approach. However, it is shown that ionosphere correction (= 40300 x TEC / frequency²) is an order of magnitude smaller in Ka-band than in Ku-band (actually divided by 7). For amplitudes of the ionosphere correction in Ku-band in the range 2-25 cm, equivalent effect in Ka- band is only 0.3-3.6 cm. Thus, for AltiKa, external ancillary data are used to compute ionosphere correction, in the form of TEC grids computed from GPS-based observations and ionosphere model (the JPL Global Ionosphere Maps – GIM – model). Other auxiliary data such as solar activity coefficients (within IRI95) are used to correct the satellite altitude. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 55 Figure 16. Example of Global Ionosphere Maps from JPL GIM model has been validated through comparisons with T/P, Jason-1, Jason-2 and ENVISAT dual frequency ionosphere corrections. As GIM fields are distributed with a 24 hours latency, the correct fields will not be available on time for OGDR processing. In that case, the last GIM field available will be used, as well as an extrapolated MOE orbit, in order to compute in advance the ionosphere correction for OGDR. The ionospheric GIM correction solution may be used over non ocean surfaces (ice, land,
