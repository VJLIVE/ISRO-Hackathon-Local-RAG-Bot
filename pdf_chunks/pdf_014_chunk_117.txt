derived with this method are based on the fact that radiances from two different spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of regard at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud radiances.       c bcd cl P N nER N R nE N R , 1    (1) Opaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:       dp dp p T N db P N t N R P N R s c p p cl c bcd ) ( , , ,    (2) Where, bcd R is the opaque ("black") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the fractional transmittance for radiation in spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric layer at pressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOR covered with cloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud top pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each Field of Regard (FOR) are plotted with the calculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the
