However, in SWIR region snow reflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has been effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al. 1995). 6.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover One of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004). This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). Another major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present Snow
