Dekadal scale The daily ETo fluctuation was high and leads to high deviation from measured AMS mean so data were summed for 10-days for further analysis. The 10-days cumulative estimated ETo was validated with cumulative ETo from AMS data. The temporal 10-day ETo over different stations are shown in Figure 7 for six selected stations and error statistics are given in Table 8. The dekadal change in estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The seasonal change was also well captured in 10-day cumulative ETo. In Naraingarh, Punjab, the comparison was made for the period from January to April. In January and February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low radiation and temperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad. The rise and fall of computed ETo was well captured in estimated ETo during
