However, the operations will be conducted throughout the whole SARAL satellite lifetime. SARAL/AltiKa was launched on X X 2012 at 0:00 GMT by a PSLV vehicle supplied by ISRO, from the main ISRO launch base, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, SHAR SRIHARIKOTA, 100 km North from Chennai. It reached it’s nominal repetitive orbit on X X 2012. The start of cycle 1 occurred on X X 2012 at 00:00:00 GMT. 2.4. SARAL/AltiKa Requirements The major elements of the mission include: • An Earth orbiting satellite carrying an altimetric system for measuring the height of the satellite above the sea surface • A precision orbit determination system for referring the altimetric measurements to geodetic coordinates • A data analysis and distribution system for processing the satellite
