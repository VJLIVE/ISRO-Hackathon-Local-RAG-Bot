The generation of the UTH product is directly based on the WV brightness temperatures. Each water vapour image is converted into different segments of 16 x 16 pixels as the averaging would reduce the error in measurements and also helps removes the pixels with partial cloud cover. The WV image pixels of each segment not belonging to contamination with medium and high cloud clusters are averaged (if there are any, otherwise no UTH value is derived for such a segment). Presently, pixels with middle and upper clouds are removed using a threshold value of IR brightness temperature of 270 K. Additionally, if UTH value exceeds 110%, then pixel is assumed to be cloud contaminated. However, this approach needs further modification. These segment WV brightness temperatures are used to derive an upper tropospheric relative humidity by using the empirical relation (2). Brightness temperatures depend strongly upon the satellite zenith angle since it increases the path length for the radiances reaching the satellite.
