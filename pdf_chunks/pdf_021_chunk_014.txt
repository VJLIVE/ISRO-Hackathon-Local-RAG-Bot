day and time. Correction of NCEP derived TPW and RH It was observed in the NCEP GFS analyzed fields that TPW and RH values are very low in the Himalayan region. For example, Fig. 7 shows the TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage) for a typical day and time, which shows very low value over Himalayan region. Such low values of TPW and RH in NCEP GFS fields are observed irrespective of date and time of the observation. Such low values are not supportive of the high rain rates in H-E method and hence the estimated rain is largely underestimated.

In order to examine, TPW and RH values with respect to altitude, we have plotted conditional probability distributions (PDF) of TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage) conditioned to different altitudes over Indian region (i.e., 0-40 N and 65-100 E) from one full month (July 2014) of NCEP GFS analyzed fields separately for each of the observation times (i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC). This is shown in Fig. 8. In which it can be seen that TPW and RH have nearly same PDFs irrespective of time of observation. Also the TPW and RH values are always very low at high altitudes. For example, for altitude above 4000 m, the TPW is always less that 1 inch and RH is always less than 50%. In order to have their values at higher altitudes comparable to that at lower altitudes, we have carried out histogram
