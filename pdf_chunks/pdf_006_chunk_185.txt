to estimate the surface component from observations in the near-infrared (e.g. 2.1 ÔÅ≠m) where aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low, the INSAT-3D imager lacks an observation at this wavelength. Therefore, a compositing method will be used to estimate the surface reflectance. The visible imagery is composited to determine the surface contribution to the top-of-the- atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. For each pixel in the visible image, the darkest observation over the course of some time period is called the composite clear reflectance. By using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes: that aerosol would increase the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the time period is somewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time period is needed for at least one cloud-free observation. Knapp et. al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. A radiative transfer model, the second simulation of satellite signal in the in the solar spectrum (6S) will be used to convert the TOA observed reflectance to a surface reflectance. This atmospheric correction removes Rayleigh scattering and gaseous Aerosols INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 158 absorption, leaving the Lambertian surface reflectance. This is then used in following calculations to retrieve aerosol optical depth in the subsequent aerosol optical depth retrieval. Cloud shadows, however, can contaminate the composite reflectance. At high solar zenith angles (i.e. during early morning and late afternoon), high clouds may cast large shadows. In the shadow regions, the direct downward solar radiance is obscured at the surface, thereby reducing the surface reflectance. The second darkest observation will be used in the composite clear reflectance (CCR) method to reduce the effect of cloud shadows. By selecting the second darkest pixel, a cloud shadow would need to be present on at least two days during the period to affect
