Algorithm Functional Specifications It is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. Clouds do not only add beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of atmospheric activities. Clouds very in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, therefore, different clouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing cumulus clouds are precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature inversion results in fog. Thin cirrus clouds are not very exciting clouds from short to medium range weather activities but play a very crucial role in earth’s heat budget and also helps in tracking upper level winds.
