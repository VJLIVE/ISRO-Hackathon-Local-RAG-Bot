be used for validation. In some cases one hourly rainfall from fast response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas where the DWR coverage is not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain rates, and hourly and daily gauge rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 169 15.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications 15.4.1. Overview: NOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. Heavy precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the global scale to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite-derived algorithms, conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide information on these various scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and flash floods. In the satellite data, global scale connections between the tropics and middle latitudes are observed. These connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor that are often associated with unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic scale, the 6.7 m water vapor is especially useful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and other features that are associated with upward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air resulting in the production of clouds and precipitation. Whether or not heavy precipitation and flash floods will occur are generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the mesoscale, infrared (10.7 m and 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring, intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, movement, and propagation of
