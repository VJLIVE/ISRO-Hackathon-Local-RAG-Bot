radio pulse is slowed by the "dry" gases and the quantity of water vapor in the Earth's troposphere. The "dry" gas contribution is nearly constant and produces height errors of approximately -2.3 m. The water vapor in the troposphere is quite variable and unpredictable and produces a height calculation error of -6 cm to -40 cm. However, these effects can be measured or modeled as discussed below. The gases in the troposphere contribute to the index of refraction. In detail, the refractive index depends on pressure and temperature. When hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law are assumed, the vertically integrated range delay is a function only of the surface pressure, see Chelton et al. [2001]. The dry meteorological tropospheric range correction is principally equal to the surface pressure multiplied by -2.277mm/mbar, with a small adjustment also necessary to reflect a small latitude dependence (see model_dry_tropo_corr parameter). model_dry_tropo_corr = [ ] phi) cos(2 0.0026 1 P -2.277 atm ∗ ∗ + ∗ ∗ where Patm is surface atmospheric pressure in mbar, phi is latitude, and model_dry_tropo_corr is the dry troposphere correction in mm. There is no straightforward way of measuring the nadir surface pressure from a satellite, so it is determined from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical weather prediction model using the surface pressure SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 54 fields. For OGDR processing, predicted ECMWF Psurf fields are used and for (I)GDR processing analyzed fields are used. 5.6.2. Wet Troposphere The amount of water vapor present along the path length contributes to the index of refraction of the Earth's atmosphere. Its contribution to the delay of the radio pulse, the wet tropospheric delay, can be estimated by measuring the atmospheric brightness near the water vapor line at 22.2356
