to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al., 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D derived product. This will be additional criteria than in build criteria of NDSI.

NDSI threshold values were changed from 0 to 1 at an interval of 0.05. If pixel is having NDSI value equal or more than threshold value then it is classified as snow. Then loss in areal extent due to increase in threshold value are converted into percent and plotted on Y-axis . X-axis indicate NDSI threshold. In general, areal extent decreases as NDSI value increases from 0 to 1. But amount of change varies from constant to rapid. In case of AWiFS scene of winter, constant drop in area in the order of 3% was observed as threshold value changes from 0 to 0.4. After threshold of 0.4 drop in area (Snow pixels) is moderate to rapid. Visual analysis suggests that all snow cover areas including snow in forest and mountain shadow can be mapped if threshold value is 0.4. In order to establish validity of this observation, the similar investigations were carried out from December to May at an interval of one month. The NDSI threshold will be fine tuned after the availability of INSAT 3D derived snow cover product. 6.4.2 Operational Implementation 6.4.1.2 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count
