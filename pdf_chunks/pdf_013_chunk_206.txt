gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; Vicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the number of steps which are already encorporated and described in Gairola et al. (2007). Based on a number of case studies and research works carried out during last few years, some more innovative elements are recognized for further refinements of the algorithm. In this regard, a three –tier correction scheme is designed for IMSRA algorithm based on the intercomparison with TRMM-3B42 rainfall estimates. The Procedure adopts an overall correction of rain followed by corrections for orography and cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Woodley , Sancho and Vicente (1972). Finally to further refine the IMSRA rainfall estimates the synergistic use of INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall and rain gauge data from IMD is proposed based on the objective criteria. Here the the original IMSRA algorithm has been retained as it is, except the environmental correction factor module has been dropped as it is adding more errors due to different decorelation lengths of rainfall and relative humidity & precipitable water. The flowchart of the modified algorithm is given in Figure 3 where recent developments have been added to the original scheme in above flowchart Figure 2, tested and implemented in many case studies by Mahesh et al. (2015). The global bias correction based on a priory data base is followed from a polynomial model of the form y=∑ ai xi, i=0...2 and the orographic correction is based on the climatology and using an elliptical weighting function (Mahesh et al., 2014). The global bias correction is designed on the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). The average bias between the rain estimates of TRMM-3B42 and IMSRA rain is absorbed into a polynomial model. Orographic correction is computed
