1 : Conversion from gray count to BT  In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured radiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite. 11.4.2.2 Step 2: Tracer selection from image  Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window. 11.4.2.3 Step 3: Height assignment  Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.  Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers.  Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above. 11.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking  The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. 11.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region. Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 175  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Calculate wind speed and direction. 11.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution U and V component of CMV m/sec 0 90
