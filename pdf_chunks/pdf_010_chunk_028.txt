to infer the OLR from the radiance measurement L(θ, Φ ) available from the broadband (4 µm – 100 µm ) radiometers (e.g CERES, ScaRab, ERBE, etc) As mentioned above, the OLR is obtained by integrating the radiances over the long-wave spectral range and over hemispheric solid angles. However, if the observations at entire (e.g 4 µm – 100 µm) spectral range are not available, a mapping function of the following form should be determined to retrieve OLR from the available, narrow band radiances: Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 34 i OLR F( N ( ))    , (4) Where  satellite zenith angle and Ni is the observed narrow band radiances in ith channel.

SBDART is designed for the analysis of a wide variety of radiative transfer problems encountered in satellite remote sensing and atmospheric energy budget studies. SBDART is based on a collection of highly developed and reliable physical models developed by the atmospheric science community. A brief description to the key components of the model is discussed below: Cloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earth’s climate by reflecting visible radiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-radiating it back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy atmosphere requires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, and the asymmetry factor,
