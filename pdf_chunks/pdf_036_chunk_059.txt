Mean Sea Surface The MSS_CNES-CLS11 model is computed from 16 years of satellite altimetry data from a variety of missions. Its main characteristics are the following : Name MSS_CNES-CLS11 Reference ellipsoid T/P Referencing time period 1993-2009 (16 years) Spatial coverage Global (80°S to 84°N) - Oceanwide where altimetric data are available. EIGEN_GRACE_5C geoid elsewhere and on continents. Spatial resolution Regular grid with a 1/30° (2 minutes) spacing (i.e. ~4 km) Grid 10801 points in longitude / 4921 points in latitude MSS determination technique Local least square collocation method on a 6' grid where altimetric data in a 200-km radius are selected. Estimation on a 2' grid based on SSH-geoid values (remove/restore technique to recover the full signal). The inverse method uses local anisotropic covariance functions that witness the MSS wavelength content. Estimation error level YES (in cm) - The Optimal Interpolation method provides a calibrated formal error Altimetric dataset T/P 10 years mean profile (first orbit), T/P tandem 3 years profile ERS-2 8 years mean profile, 1 year ERS-1 (geodetic phase) GFO, 7 years mean profile Jason-1, 7 years mean profile Envisat, 7 years mean profile Table 10 : MSS_CNES-CLS11 model characteristics Figure 13 : Mean Sea Surface MSS_CNES-CLS11.
