and “p2” as defined below (8) As mentioned above, thin-isolated layers (TILs) have also been derived from two Thick-overlapping layers (TOLs) as follows. From known LARH values for two TOLs with pressure levels “p1” to “p3” and “p2” to “p3”, the LARH value for a TIL with pressure levels “p1” to “p2” can be derived as (9a) (9b) (9c) The LARH for TIL between “p1” to “p2” is derived using expressions (9b and 9c) as Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 50 (9d) The relationship between brightness temperature and TOL for SAPHIR channels is established as given as (10) Where TOL is the layer averaged relative humidity in percent, A0,p is the retrieval constant for pth layer, A1i,p and A2i,p are retrieval coefficient for ith channel, TBi is brightness temperatures of ith SAPHIR channel with six channels. The coefficients have been established using the simulated BT from the simulated clear sky atmospheres mentioned above. The noise in all BT’s has been introduced as per the noise characteristics of SAPHIR instrument. TIL are derived from TOL from the following relationship (11) Where, these TOL’s are those having the desired TIL as their difference. 4.5.2 Flow-chart: Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 51 Figure 2: Flow chart of the Retrieval Algorithm for Humidity profile from SAPHIR 4.6 Operational implementation Operational implementation of the retrieval scheme for SAPHIR Sounder includes the following procedures:  Development of forward radiative transfer model to compute SAPHIR channels brightness temperatures given various atmospheric and surface conditions as input.  Identification of cloud and rain free pixels  Derivation of retrieval coefficients for layer averaged relative humidity at different layers from SAPHIR brightness temperatures using statistical regression. 4.7 Outputs LARH (TIL) Unit Min Max Expected Accuracy (%) Resolution- horizontal (km) Layer-1(1000-850) mb % 0.1 100 ~20 10 Layer-2 (850-700) mb % 0.1
