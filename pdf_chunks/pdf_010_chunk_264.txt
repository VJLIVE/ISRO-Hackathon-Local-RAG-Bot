Cirrus clouds are somewhat reflective of solar radiation and cumulus clouds are highly reflective in the MIR channel. Since low-level cumulus clouds are the main source of targets for low-level cloud-drift winds, this reflectance causes tracking problems due to saturation effects. The reflected solar energy received at the INSAT-3D sensor from the cumulus clouds can make them appear to be warmer than even the underlying ocean surface at times. This makes tracer selection extremely difficult and erroneous. Therefore, the usefulness of this channel for winds derivation to be limited to nighttime applications because of its sensitivity to solar contamination. 14.4.1.1.2 MIR Image Enhancements The MIR channel is characterized by relatively small gradients in brightness temperatures in the warmer low levels. This limits the ability of the tracking algorithm to detect viable cloud targets and resultant tracers over time. A technique was developed at CIMSS (Velden and Dunion 2001) to enhance the MIR imagery by stretching the brightness temperature contrast in the warmer end of the spectrum (low levels). Specifically, the brightness temperature range from 50-160 is stretched. This enhancement greatly improves the gradients in the low- levels at the cost of confining the mid to upper-level gradients in
