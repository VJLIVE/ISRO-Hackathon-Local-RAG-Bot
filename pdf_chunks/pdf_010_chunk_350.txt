of the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D satellite using a radiative transfer (RT) model over India. Study also presents the comparison of INSAT-3D LST to the contemporaneous LST products available from the MODIS and K1 satellites. Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 284 18.2.2 Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D INSAT-3D is the new generation Indian Earth observation satellite launched by ISRO on July 26, 2013. It provides enhanced observations of land, ocean and atmosphere through two payloads namely Imager and Sounder from the geostationary orbit. The Imager payload is designed to sense solar-reflected and radiant energy from the Earth through six channels covering visible (VIS: 0.55-0.75 m), shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1.55-1.70 m), middle infrared (MIR: 3.8-4.0 m), water vapor infrared (WVIR: 6.5-7.1 m) and thermal infrared (TIR1: 10.3-11.3 m and TIR2: 11.5-12.5 m) spectral regions of electromagnetic spectrum having varying spatial resolution ranging from 1 km to 8 km (CDR, 2009). Nominal specifications of spectral and spatial details of the Imager payload are provided in table 1. Table 1: Spectral and spatial specifications of Imager payload onboard INSAT-3D satellite (Source: CDR, 2009) Channel Range of the Spectral channel Spatial resolution (at nadir) VIS 0.55-0.75 m 1 km SWIR 1.55-1.70 m 1 km MIR 3.80-4.00 m 4 km WVIR 6.50-7.10 m 8 km TIR1 10.3-11.3 m 4 km TIR2 11.5-12.5 m 4 km The TIR1 and TIR2 are two thermal channels centered at 10.8 m and 12.0 m respectively, which can be used to derive LST through a split-window algorithm. Figure 1 shows the spectral response functions of TIR channels of INSAT-3D Imager. The INSAT-3D satellite views the Earth’s globe from its location of 84 degree East on the equator. The view zenith angle for INSAT-3D satellite from this particular location was computed by the method developed by Pandya & Dadhwal
