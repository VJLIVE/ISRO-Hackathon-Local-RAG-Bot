will not be covered by cloud continuously at a particular time for several (user defined no.) days and the maximum brightness temperature will represent the clear sky background temperature of that location. This will be the reference background temperature on which the threshold for a particular location will be determined to discriminate cloud. First step : Generation of BTmax BTmax = max (BT11 of each time of previous several (user defined no.) days) Default number of days for clear composite image is 20. Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 20 SIMPLE BT THRESHOLD TEST Several infrared window threshold and temperature difference techniques have been developed. These algorithms are most effective for cold clouds over water and must be used with caution in other situations. The first infrared test to apply is a simple threshold test. When the brightness temperature in the 11 μm (BT11) channel is less by some threshold value than the maximum BT at that location, we assume the pixel to fail the clear-sky condition, because the change in BT will not be more than these due to change in other atmospheric condition.This was determined by some radiative transfer simulation for different atmospheric condition. This test gives a first set of cloudy pixels in the image. Second step : First set of cloudy pixels Over land : If (BTmax – BT11 ) > 12 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels) Over ocean : If (BTmax – BT11 ) > 6 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels) Third step : First set of clear pixels. If abs(BTmax – BT11 ) < 2 K, then Cloudflag = 0 (Clear sky pixel) For rest of the points Cloudflag = 9 ( For further test ) For points with Cloudflag = 9 , SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATION
