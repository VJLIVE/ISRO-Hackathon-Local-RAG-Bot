10.2.2 Objective The objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional to the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian region on twice daily basis. As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical thickness cannot be found for cloudy pixels. Retrievals are only performed during the daytime due to the lack of light in the visible channel of INSAT-3D imager data during the nighttime. The overall objectives of the aerosol retrieval is: To determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 650 nm and 4 Km spatial resolution over both land and ocean surfaces with root mean square (RMS) error of ±0.1. Optical thickness () is related to transmission (t) by t=exp(-). Optical thickness retrievals apply only under clear and daytime conditions. 10.3 Inputs 10.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Digital Elevation model 5 minutes -- -- ETOPO5 Spectral Response Function (SRF) for Imager bands 1nm -- -- Sensor Group of Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad 10.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected radiance values of visible channel (0.55- 0.75 m) 4 Km 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-1 channel (10.5) 4 Km 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray 4 Km 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Aerosols INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 155 count values of TIR-2 channel (11.5) Geolocation file Along with sun zenith & azimuth and sensor zenith and azimuth information Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP At least 20 data data for Visible band should be available for 1030 and 1330 hrs for the generation of Clear composite reflectance image for
