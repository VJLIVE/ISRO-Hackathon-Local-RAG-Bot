values are always very low at high altitudes. For example, for altitude above 4000 m, the TPW is always less that 1 inch and RH is always less than 50%. In order to have their values at higher altitudes comparable to that at lower altitudes, we have carried out histogram matching with respect to their (b) (a) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 13 corresponding values between 0-500 m values. By histogram matching we intend to make their probability of occurrence same at all altitudes. The Fig. 9 shows the corresponding PDF values before and after histogram matching. Fig. 9: Probability distributions at different altitudes with one month of NCEP GFS model fields at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC of (a) TPW, (b) TPW after histogram equalization, (c) RH, (d) RH after histogram equalization. Fig. 10: (a) TPW, and (b) RH after applying histogram equalization to values in Fig. 7. (b) (a) (c) (d) (b) (a) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 14 Figure 9 (a) and (c) show the conditional PDFs of TPW and RH with all time data from Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 (b) and (d) show them after carrying out histogram equalization. The Fig. 9 shows that with histogram equalization the probability of occurrence of TPW and RH value is nearly same irrespective of altitude. The correction based on histogram equalization (Fig. 9) is applied to TPW and RH values shown in Fig. 7. The modified TPW and RH values are provided in Fig. 10. The Fig. 10 looks similar to Fig. 7 except corresponding values over Himalayan region which are now have higher values compared to those in Fig. 7. We expect that this correction in TPW and RH will help getting more representative rain values from H-E. 5.1 Correction of Equilibrium Level / Level of Neutral Buoyancy
