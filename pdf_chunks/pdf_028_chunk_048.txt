co & ci = retrieval coefficients for parameter G for ith channel Post-Launch Scenario After MT-MADRAS is launched and the collocated in situ data are available, we will calibrate the pre-launch algorithm by making small adjustments to the coefficients of the retrieval algorithms presented in section 3.5. This will be carried out based on validation results.
