the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only low earth orbiting satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as on now. With the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single satellite (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisaged that a technique like GMSRA can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information can be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the techniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below (mainly in cases of IMSRA). A1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method: 1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E using Arkinâ€™s GPI method. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 166 2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude/longitude. 3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 images a day). 4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data. 5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc. 6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales after due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. A2. To
