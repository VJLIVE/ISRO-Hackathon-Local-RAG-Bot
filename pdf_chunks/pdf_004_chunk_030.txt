be ignored because of the retrieval skill halved 25 due to the symmetry of the measurement geometry and the pairing of solutions as mentioned in earlier sections. Subsequent to the ambiguity filtering in rest of the inner beam swath, wind solutions over the sub-satellite track should then be considered and the ambiguity filtering process should be repeated. This approach is crude. However, the DIRTH algorithm (Stiles et al, 2002) must be used for the purpose and its implementation is being worked out. It is important to note that while using pencil-beam scatterometer, a narrow region of data swath centered at the sub-satellite track may have many data points with wind vector solutions not corresponding to the correct wind direction. This needs special processing and also requires external data like model surface analysis/forecast on operational basis. More so, in the outer region of the data swath where only two radar backscatter observations are available, the ranking of wind vector solutions becomes irrelevant while one of the solutions represents true wind direction. This also needs external data like numerical weather prediction model winds for ranking the solutions. 5.2.3 Directional ambiguity removal over exclusive outer beam swath: Over the exclusive outer beam swath region where the backscatter measurements from only one beam but in two azimuth directions are available, the wind vector solutions do not have any meaningful ranking. Due to this reason, the derived solutions at all data locations are assigned rank-1 priority based on the model wind direction and are used along with inner beam solutions for ambiguity filtering through normal filter process as shown in block diagram of figure (12).
