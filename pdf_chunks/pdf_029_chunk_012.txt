OCM-2 is continuously providing data over the ocean as well as on land and is still in service. Since OCM-2 is particularly designed for ocean colour studies, the ocean observation is planned at the local time of equator crossing 11 time of 1200 hours noon, the camera can be tilted up to ± 20° in the along-track direction to avoid sun glint. Table 2 shows the salient characteristics of the OCM-2 sensor. Figure 1 shows the spectral responses of the channels. OCM-2 data is available in two spatial resolutions: Local Area Coverage (LAC) of 360 m and Global Area Coverage (GAC) of 1 km. To meet the objective of covering oceans around the Indian region, Real-Time LAC data is routinely received at the NRSC primary ground station. The area of coverage in LAC mode is shown in figure 2. Table 3 shows various performance parameters of OCM-2. Table 2. Specification of Ocean Colour Monitor on-board OceanSat-2. S.N.
