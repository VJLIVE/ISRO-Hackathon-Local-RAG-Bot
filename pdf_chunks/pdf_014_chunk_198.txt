are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are given below: 15.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm: 15.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 171 brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is related to its physical temperature T by following equation: Tb =  T where,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a white body; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, measured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those surfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated by effective emissivity times fourth
