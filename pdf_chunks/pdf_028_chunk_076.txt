The pressure and temperature so calculated are the dry pressure and dry temperature, distinct from real pressure and temperature in the water vapor dominant region (i.e. lower troposphere). 4. Deriving water vapor partial pressure with a simultaneous refinement of dry temperature and pressure to get real state parameters.

The impact parameter (a) is defined, assuming spherical symmetry, as the perpendicular distance between the center of the Earth (more precisely the center of local curvature at the perigee of the occultation ray) and the ray asymptote at the GPS or LEO satellite. The atmospheric Doppler shift, f, can be related to the direction of the transmitted and received signals by the expression ]ˆ ). ( ˆ. ˆ.

Equation (1) is difference of Doppler shift observed in the presence of the atmosphere and the Doppler shift that would be observed for the same transmitter- receiver geometry in the absence of the atmosphere. The first order relativistic contributions to the Doppler are identical in the two situations and cancel out. Equation (1) holds for atmosphere of any shape. However, (1) also has infinite number of solutions, since kt and kr are unknown,
