e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some statistical relationship. In case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when available to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of hydrometeors during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 mm) and 5 (12 mm). The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness temperature, and the 12-mm channel is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then subtracted from measurements of that channel to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm spectral band. In the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite sensor and surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT. The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly rainfall over large areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal errors cancel each other in the aggregation procedure. Complete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3D,3DR VHRR data from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been attempted. Both of them are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are given below: 15.4.1.1.
