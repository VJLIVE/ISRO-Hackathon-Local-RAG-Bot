equation developed by Bhattacharya et al. (2010) based on differences in brightness temperatures in thermal IR and WV channels of Kalpana-1 VHRR. The aerosol optical depth at 550 nm from MODIS product was converted to Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 345 Angstrom ‘β’ turbidity parameter to compute aerosol transmittance assuming Angstrom turbidity exponent parameter as 1.3 ( Iqbal 1983 ). The ozone data from MODIS was used to compute ozone transmittance. The monthly minimum ground brightness from previous thirty days VIS band planetary albedo was dynamically determined for each acquisition and was used as surrogate for ground albedo The planetary VIS band spectral albedo was corrected for Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering effect and cloud interferences on planetary albedo were assumed to be removed with monthly minimum composites understanding that surface properties have not changed significantly within thirty days. The multiple scattering component contributes little to total diffuse irradiance over vegetated region (albedo between 0.1 and 0.3) but is a dominant component over snow bound areas or desert ( > 0.3) with significantly higher albedo. 20.4.1.3 Global or total irradiance Both direct and diffuse irradiance are dependent on the zenith angle of the sun that changes from sunrise to sunset and on the orientation of the surface. On an arbitrarily inclined surface with slope,  , and aspect,  , at a given location on earth surface with latitude, , the angle between the incident radiation and the normal to the surface is expressed as , (12) (13)  = solar declination angle (radian) h = sun hour angle (radian) Depending on the terrain properties and solar geometry, the surface may be in the shadow of nearby topographic features; is then assigned a value of zero that represents no direct irradiances. Diffuse radiation was assumed to
