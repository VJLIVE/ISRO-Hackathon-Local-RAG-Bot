(3 through 5) for the remaining trial directions varied with an interval δχ with wind corresponding to wind speed regimes given by equation (14). 7) Find vector solutions by searching minima of MLCF2prcn along trial direction. Denote number of solutions as NS and their serial numbers as n. The solutions of wind speed, direction and the corresponding MLCF thus obtained are denoted by WSn, χn and MLCFn, respectively, where n varies from 1 to NS. 8) Find precision direction solution χn prcn around χn by finding minimum of MLCF2prcn through quadratic fit of MLCF2prcn values calculated for χ varied between χn and χn ±3δχ with 1° direction interval. 9) Find WSn prcn and MLCFn prcn at the precision direction solution χn prcn following steps (3 through 5) exploiting the wind speed regime of (χn - δχ)th trial direction. 10) Repeat step 9 for all NS solutions. 11) Rank wind vector solutions on the basis of MLCF values. The wind vector solution having minimum MLCF is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. In step 8 for MLE and steps 5 and 6 for NSD implementations, the continuity of the trial direction (circular data) and associated parameters around upwind direction is maintained. The above schemes are found to be effective in finding precise solutions not only for maintaining the direction retrieval skill of the algorithm under varying δχ (finer to coarser) and for minimizing the artifacts of search intervals and quadratic fitting but also for enhancing the computational efficiency. The typical values of search intervals mentioned above are optimized based on the noise free cases considering the entire inner beam swath including nadir region. The litmus test for proper implementation of the algorithm is that the retrieval skill for the noise free cases must be 100%. The condition shown by expression
