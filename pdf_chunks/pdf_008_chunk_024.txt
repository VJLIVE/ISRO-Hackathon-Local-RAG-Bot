provided in WWR. We averaged gridded rain values and generated weekly rain maps similar to those provided in WWR. The comparison statistics of IMD gridded dataset with WWR is provided in Table 6 below: Table 6: Comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD with WWR. IMD daily grided data versus IMD Weekly Weather Report All 10 Weeks R = 0.97 rmse = 16.36 Bias = -0.37 We expect a near perfect comparison between IMD gridded data and IMD WWR but there exists marked difference between them. SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 21 The Table 3 shows the comparison between rain values from modified H-E and WWR, but that does not give any indication of performance of H-E in different meteorological sub-divisions. In Table 7, we have made comparison in different subdivisions and presented the statics. Herein comparison over Lakshadweep is not provided as that is considered to represent maritime environment. It can be observed that high correlation exist in all the subdivisions except in Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura (NMMT) and Coastal AP, which needs further investigation. Similar comparison between 3B42 V7 and modified H-E is also attempted, which is shown in Table 8. From Table 8, it can be observed that the correlation of modified H-E rain with 3B42 V7 over NMMT and Coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) is 0.32 and 0.64 which is not as poor as in Table 7. Thus any study to understand large difference in these two met subdivisions in Table 7 needs to take cognition of this fact that the 3B42 V7 and H-E are uniformly measured spatially averaged measurements. The coarser correlation as observed in Table 7 in NMMT and Coastal AP may be due to high variability of precipitation in these regions associated with geolocation error in the INSAT-3D
