x 25 km Daily Chlorophyll from OCM-3 (GAC product) 1 km Daily 3. Algorithm Functional Specifications In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for generating daily analysed fields of ocean surface chlorophyll for the global ocean. 3.1. Overview OCM-3 derived chlorophyll products are assimilated into the coupled model using particle filter technique to generate more improved fields of model chlorophyll state. Bootstrap technique is used to generate particles/ensembles from model background field, which is chlorophyll field at ocean surface. A gridded field of OCM3 derived chlorophyll fields at 4 km is generated daily for the global ocean as an intermediate product. These three major steps in the algorithm are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Major steps involved in the generation of analysed chlorophyll product 3.2. Generation of 4km gridded fields of OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll (Intermediate product): GAC products of chlorophyll for the global ocean are available scene wise and includes many number of GAC data products for a single day. Therefore, an intermediate product of OCM-3 chlorophyll is generated daily for the global ocean at 4 km resolution. For the purpose, firstly a background data with 4 km pixel resolution is generated for the global ocean. Secondly, each of the GAC products are scanned location wise and corresponding chlorophyll value is allotted to the specific 4 km pixel corresponding to the location. Figure 2 shows flowchart of generating the gridded fields of OCM-3 chlorophyll for the global ocean. For an example, the gridded OCM- 3 derived chlorophyll for the global ocean is shown for 28 November 2023. More than 200 GAC scenes were considered to generate gridded OCM-3 product for the mentioned day. Figure 2: Flowchart of gridded 4 km OCM-3 chlorophyll data for the global ocean.
