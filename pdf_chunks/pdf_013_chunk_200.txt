Clouds Fractional Rain Cloud Estimation of Rainfall Generation of 24 Classes Histogram, mean & variance Estimation of daily Rainfall (8 images) Estimation of Daily, Weekly, Monthly Rainfall INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 173 15.4.1.1.3. Operational Implementation Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT The INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, …., 2100 UTC, i.e., every three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, 3DR, so that several pixels fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of each pixel in a given image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be calculated from a look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be ignored while within it are assigned to appropriate box. Step 2: Histogram Generation: After the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed to generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and 30 to 130 deg longitude from the sub-satellite point. Step 3: Grid-wise Statistics Generate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. Step 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: The fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler than specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon will be carried out. This work
