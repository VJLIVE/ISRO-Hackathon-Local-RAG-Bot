The wind forcing generates a spectrum of surface waves in which growth of capillary waves is directly influenced by wind intensity. The basic mechanism at work is the Bragg Resonance, in which the waves satisfying Bragg’s condition produce strong radar backscatter energy. The backscatter signal also depends upon the incidence angle of radar beam. The directional anisotropy of the radar signal, caused by the azimuth symmetry of sea surface roughness, yields multiple solutions of derived wind vectors (especially direction). Among these, only one solution is “true” and remaining solutions are known as directional “ambiguities”. Multi-beam scatterometer is used to overcome this problem of ambiguities to a certain extent. The radar backscatter shows a harmonic nature as expressed by (Ulaby et al, 1981, Wentz and Smith, 1999 and others) 6 0(W, ϕ, p, θ) = Σ Nh i=0Bi.cos (i.ϕ) with Bi= Pi(p,θ).WQ i (p,θ) 1 where, ϕ is relative wind direction (ϕ = χ- φ), an angle between radar azimuth φ and wind direction χ both measured in meteorological convention (clockwise from local North direction with a zero degree wind direction representing a wind blowing from North to the point of observation). Here, the ocean surface wind speed W is at neutral stability height of 10 m.
