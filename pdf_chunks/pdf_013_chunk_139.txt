Introduction In this document, we offer some background to the cloud microphysics retrieval over oceans using INSAT-3D imager data, describe the theoretical basis of the cloud microphysics retrieval algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm implementation, the technical issues and the future scope. 11.3. Overview and Background Clouds are suspension of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. They are of varying sizes and shapes. They can be of water, ice or mixed phase. The size of cloud droplets is of the order of 10 Âµm. Clouds strongly modulate the Earths energy balance and its atmosphere through their interaction with the solar and terrestrial radiation (Roebeling et al., 2005). Their impact on the radiation budget can result in a heating or cooling of the planet, depending on the radiative
