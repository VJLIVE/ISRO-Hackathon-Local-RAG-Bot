and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast). The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at three hourly interval upto 72 hours. Examples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast product of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over Indian region are shown in Figure 1.
