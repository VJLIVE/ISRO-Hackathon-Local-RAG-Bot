globally averaged RMS accuracy of 4.6 cm (1 sigma), or better, assuming 1 second averages. The instrumental and environmental corrections are provided with the appropriate accuracy to meet this requirement. In addition to these requirements, a set of measurement-system goals was established based on the anticipated impact of off-line ground processing improvements. These improvements are expected to enable reduction of sea-surface height errors to 2.8 cm RMS. Knowledge of the stability of the system is especially important to the goal of monitoring the change in the global mean sea level, hence a specification on the system drift with a 1 mm/year goal. The following table provides a summary of specifications and error budget at the end of the verification phase.

Sampling Strategy As for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured along a fixed grid of subsatellite tracks such that it is possible to investigate and minimize the spatial and temporal aliases of surface geostrophic currents and to minimize the influence of the geoid on measurements
