elements of the mission include: • An Earth orbiting satellite carrying an altimetric system for measuring the height of the satellite above the sea surface • A precision orbit determination system for referring the altimetric measurements to geodetic coordinates • A data analysis and distribution system for processing the satellite data, verifying their accuracy, and making them available to the scientific community • A Principal Investigator program for feedback from operational applications and scientific studies based on the satellite observations The sea-surface height measurement must be made with an accuracy of 3.4 cm or better (at 1 Hz) in order to meet the mission objectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to fulfill the mission objectives (see AD 6) and to take over from the Jason-1/2 mission. As for Jason- 1/2, distribution of altimetric products (non-validated) in near real time is planned. The interim (IGDR) and definitive (GDR) science products are delivered later (within 1.5 days for IGDR and within 40 days for GDR), following the model used for Jason-1 and Jason-2. To ensure that science and mission goals are accomplished by the SARAL/AltiKa mission, the following requirements were established. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 11 2.4.1. Accuracy of Sea-level Measurements Generally speaking SARAL/AltiKa has been specified based on the Jason-2 state of the art, including improvements in payload technology, data processing and algorithms or ancillary data (e.g: precise orbit determination and meteorological model accuracy). The sea-surface height shall be provided with a globally averaged RMS accuracy of 4.6 cm (1 sigma), or better, assuming 1 second averages. The instrumental and environmental corrections are provided with the appropriate accuracy to meet this requirement. In addition to these requirements, a set of measurement-system goals was established based on the anticipated impact of off-line ground
