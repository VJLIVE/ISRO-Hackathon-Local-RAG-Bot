instruments are somewhat restricted due their relative infrequent sampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms for merging of microwave data with IR images to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal resolutions of the IR sensor is highly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall estimates using the temporal sampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the microwave estimates, avoiding the mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At present we have proposed to use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves for the rainfall estimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground truth. In future this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and microwave Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 64 measurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall than any of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone. 4.9 References 1.
