water vapour, the atmosphere is sufficiently optically thin that the difference between the measured temperature in any band and the true surface temperature can be parameterized as a simple function of the difference between the measured temperatures in two bands with different atmospheric transmissions. Linear algorithms like Multi Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) are based on a formula of the following form for the surface temperature Ts. 𝑇𝑠= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑇𝑖+ 𝛾(𝑇𝑖−𝑇𝑗) (1) where, the Ti’s are the brightness temperatures in various bands for a given location and α, β and γ give the parametrized correction (Deschamps and Phulpin 1980, Llewellyn-Jones et al., 1984), or can be derived empirically from good composite sets of surface and satellite observations (Prabhakara, et al., 1974). Although Eq. (1) is easy to implement, it does not permit correction for changes in air mass due to scan-angle. Llewellyn-Jones et al., (1984) develop a table from numerical simulations which permits modification of Eq. (1) into a form: 𝑇𝑠= 𝛼+ 𝛽′𝑇𝑖+ 𝛾′(𝑇𝑖−𝑇𝑗) + 𝛿(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1) (2) where, θ is the satellite zenith angle and δ is an additional scan angle coefficient. This approach reduces the errors at large scan angles for moist atmospheres by more than 1K. This form, however, while improving the error behavior at large scan angles, does not adequately control the residual behavior at high temperatures. A further generalization of this approach is to posit a non-linear structure for the SST estimator. For that a NLSST (non-linear SST) atmospheric equation uses the form: SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 7 𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎3(𝑇1 −𝑇2). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) (3) where, SST is the satellite derived SST estimate, T1 and T2 are the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3DR thermal channels (TIR-1 and TIR-2). a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are the retrieval coefficients estimated from
