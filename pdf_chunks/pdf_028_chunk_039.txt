similar payload SAMIR-II launched onboard Bhaskara-2 satellite in 1981. After a gap of nearly two decades, India launched microwave radiometer MSMR onboard Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) satellite in May 1999. The MSMR provided the measured the measurements of radiances at 6.6, 10, 19 and 22 GHz channels. Gohil (1999) and Gohil et al. (2000a, 2000b) provided the description of the retrieval Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 30 algorithms for geophysical parameters like integrated water vapor (IWV), cloud liquid water (CLW), wind speed (WS) and sea surface temperature (SST) from the MSMR. Apart from these parameters MSMR was also exploited for rain measurements (Varma et al., 2002a, Varma et al., 2003, Pokhrel et al., 2003, Gairola et al, 2004)) even in the severe weather conditions like cyclone (Varma et al., 2006). The MSMR derived geophysical parameters were found to be in good agreement with ground and the other satellite observations (Varma et al., 2002b). 3.3 Overview and Background This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) focuses on the MADRAS microwave radiometer that is scheduled to fly in 2008/2009 on the MT mission. MADRAS will measure the Earthâ€™s radiation over the spectral range from 19 to 157 GHz. over the entire globe within tropics. The channel details and expected accuracies are given in the Table 1 (Desbois, 1999). For convenience, we will refer 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89 and 157 GHz frequencies as 19, 24, 37, 89 and 157 GHz, respectively. It will be possible to retrieve the three important geophysical parameters, IWV, WS and CLW. Rainfall can also be retrieved, which is discussed in a separate MT ATBD. The parameters are to be retrieved under the non-raining situations because at the microwave frequencies used for retrieval of the above parameters the emission due to rain is very strong and than obscure the effect of the other
