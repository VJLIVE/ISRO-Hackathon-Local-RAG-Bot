and 1.4% respectively over plain and pleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to increase in the hilly terrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET0 would have substantial errors propagated mainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the other hand, the operational product on daily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced around 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) with respect to same ground reference and the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 202 weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud flagging and the spatial resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected to produce substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily insolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional product of potential evapo-transpiration. 17.2.2. Objectives The objectives of this document are :  To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ETo) based on Penman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model)  To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs average operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution to generate product of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution  To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for automation of ETo product generation  To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results 17.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products 17.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D) The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system,
