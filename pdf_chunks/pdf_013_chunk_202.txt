Technique: 15.4.1.2.1. Theoretical Background: The developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) proposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along with innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) for the estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that 1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. 2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. 3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging clouds. 4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a convective system. 5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and thus effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during day time). 6. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the associated instantaneous rain rate will be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain rate and cloud top brightness temperature relationship based on the equation developed using al large data base of IR-TBs and TRMM-Precipitation Radar data (Gairola et al. 2010b) The retrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations in India would be used for offline validation of the algorithm. This will be based on the large collocated data base of DWR and IMSRA rainfall within 0.1x0.1 deg resolution. 7. Production of rainfall maps on every half hourly and daily basis on pixel scale with option for higher grid spacing. Several such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using measurements from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.).
