channels. We examined the effect of pixels with false rain and missing rain on rain identification. We find that their effect is limited to only very low rain regime. We further compared the rain identified by SAPHIR with TRMM-3B42 and that shows a good match at rain rates > 0.25 mm/h. It may be recalled that TRMM-3B42 is an IR-Microwave merged product and hence suppose to offer better estimate of rainfall than either of them. In the second step, we have tried to estimate rain rate at the rainy pixels. The rain measurement algorithm alone explains a correlation of 0.70, rms error of 0.81 mm/h and bias of 0.04 mm/h. Together with the rain identification procedure; it explains correlation of 0.68 with rms error of 0.45 mm/h, and bias of 0.01 mm/h. The algorithm is applied to independent SAPHIR dataset and comparison results are presented. Further, monthly rain is compared with TRMM-3B42 rain, which explains a correlation of 0.84 and standard deviation 0.09 mm/h. Furthermore, we have compared the instantaneous rain associated with Phailin cyclone from SAPHIR with other standard satellite based rain products like, GSMaP, 3B42, 3B40-RT and found SAPHIR is very well able to capture the intensity and features of intense rain also. The comparison statistics presented in this report show that the SAPHIR rain retrieval algorithm works very well for rain identification as well as for rain estimation at instantaneous, daily and monthly basis. The comparison at instantaneous basis with independent dataset (test dataset) gives us confidence that algorithm works satisfactorily. 4. Operational Implementation Steps (a) We have static binary files for rain/no-rain probability over land and oceans. For given geolocation (land/ocean) and pixel-scan position, the probabilities of rain/no-rain for brightness temperature from each of the six channels are instantaneously available. These procedures are incorporated in the
