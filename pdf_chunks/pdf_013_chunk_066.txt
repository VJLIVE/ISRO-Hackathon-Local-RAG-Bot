GIOVANNI site 4.8. Sensitivity analysis of STIC model simulated latent heat flux on LST and Albedo The accuracy of STIC model heavily depends on the quality of land surface temperature data due to its role in retrieving TSD and M. One-dimensional sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify the impacts of uncertainty in TS and albedo on λE. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by increasing and decreasing LST systematically from its original value while keeping the other variables and parameters constant. This procedure was selected because the fluxes and other intermediate outputs of STIC model reflect an integrated effect of change in LST. Firstly, surface fluxes (λE) were computed using the original LST data obtained from EC tower observations. Then LST was increased and decreased at constant interval and a new set of fluxes were computed. It was found that λE was sensitive to the LST uncertainties with a magnitude of error ranging 2-12 % for LST error in the range of 0.5 - 3K.

Sensitivity analysis of λE on albedo The deviation in λE from reference was found to be from 3-10 % albedo change in the range of of 2-10 % from its reference value.
