Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6μm, NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm, IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. 15.2.2. Objectives There are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These techniques are now known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm Technique (IMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at estimation of rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal requirements respectively. First GPI related objectives are the implementation of the algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the second one is related to the development of the algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber (2001). Originally the GPI technique has been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by National community for more than two decades. The IMSRA on the other hand is a new one and is developed The inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance emanating from cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only marginally even with significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal coverage of Geostationary optical measurements is the very strong point along with the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and
