detritus and CDOM absorption coefficient from remote sensing reflectance is novel and can be used globally. Still, there is even much more scope for their further improvements as well.

Conclusion In this study, ABOM with suitable parameterization has been presented to derive chl-a in optically complex waters. In addition, an attempt was made to correct for the CDOM slope bias by introducing empirically derived expression in Fig. 3, using NOMAD data for global waters. This study concludes that ABOM-derived chl-a (mg/m3) improves significantly with an uncertainty of 58% as compared to GSM (175%) and Leeâ€“Bio (189%) algorithms. Further the study reveals the bio-optical models developed for global oceans needs to be regionally parameterized for optical components in complex waters bodies to
