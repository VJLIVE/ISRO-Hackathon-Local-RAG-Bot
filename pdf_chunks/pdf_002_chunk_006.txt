higher sensitivity of SAPHIR 18311 GHz channel to precipitating clouds. SAPHIR on MT collects microwave radiances from the environment at 6 channels around water vapor absorption band at 183.3 GHz. These channels are referred as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 with central operating frequency of 183.31±0.2 GHz, 183.31±1.1 GHz, 183.31±2.8 GHz, 183.31±4.2 GHz, 183.31±6.8 GHz, and 183.31±11.0 GHz. The SAPHIR sweeps a swath of ~1700 km while carrying out cross-track scanning of 50o on both sides of the nadir. The SAPHIR swath dataset comprises of 182 pixels with 91 pixels on both sides of the nadir. It provides variable local incidence angle along the swath at the surface of the Earth. The spatial resolution also varies along the swath from 10 km at nadir to about 22 km at pixel locations 1 and 182. In the present study 4 we have used SAPHIR swath observations of period from March - May 2013 and also of Phaillin Cyclone over the Bay of Bengal on 11 October 2013. In this report, we make an attempt to detect and determine precipitation amount using SAPHIR frequencies near water vapor absorption line at 183.31 GHz (Table-2). The rain measured from SAPHIR may provide an alternate and independent set of measurements to fulfill the MT Science objectives, especially in view of absence of MADRAS measurements. 2. Rain Detection Rain identification algorithm is an integral part of any satellite passive microwave based rain retrieval algorithm. At microwave frequencies (say, from 6 GHz to 190 GHz) variations in the surface emissivity, surface and atmospheric temperature, water vapor, cloud liquid water or wind speed may produce the brightness temperature (Tb) variations of the same order as that due to rain rates. Apart from that the uncertainties observed in the brightness temperature versus rain rate relationship due to
