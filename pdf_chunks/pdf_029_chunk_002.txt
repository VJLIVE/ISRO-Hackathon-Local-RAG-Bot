idea of aerosol remote sensing over land with existing algorithm. For this reason, to date OCM-2 was limited to ocean colour applications only. This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes a novel algorithm for remote sensing of aerosol over land using spectral reflectance observed by OCM-2. The algorithm retrieves the aerosol optical depth (AOD) as the primary product and fine mode fraction as a proxy for the size distribution (can be associated with anthropogenic sources) of the undisturbed aerosol column over most of the Indian landmass. The unique characteristic of OCM-2 is the presence of two narrow blue channels (0.44 and 0.49 um), which is taken as an advantage in this algorithm for the resolution of aerosol type while optical depth inversion. The presence of two blue channels also allows full use of red and near- infrared (NIR) channels for surface characterization without any assumption on the transparency of aerosol in red and NIR bands. These two facts make this algorithm different from existing ones and also make aerosol remote sensing possible with OCM-2 sensor which does not have measurement capabilities beyond NIR like MODIS, VIIRS, and GOES-R, and do not have multi- viewings like MISR and PARASOL. The high brightness combined with spatial homogeneity of clouds in visible channels allows reasonably good cloud rejection while aerosol estimation. Co-located sun photometer validation is provided for the aerosol product. The prime objectives for developing this aerosol product are to cater main input for air-quality, radiative budget, and climate applications, especially over Indian landmass. The high spatial resolution of 700 meters makes this product unique among globally available aerosol products. Apart from these, it will open the door for the utilization of OCM-2 data for other land applications also. Since OCM-2 in local area coverage mode have 2-day repetivity, the temporal resolution
