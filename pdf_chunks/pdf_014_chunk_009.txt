estimate the expected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 14 1.2.1. Overview and background The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days snow covered digital map products will be generated. Snow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are covered by snow during winter time. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can affect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni et al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important parameter for various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche investigation. Snow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, the potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development of higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, satellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et al. 2006). This is possibly due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared region. Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively
