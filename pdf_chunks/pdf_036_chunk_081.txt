be available on time for OGDR processing. In that case, the last GIM field available will be used, as well as an extrapolated MOE orbit, in order to compute in advance the ionosphere correction for OGDR. The ionospheric GIM correction solution may be used over non ocean surfaces (ice, land, etc.). 5.6.4. Ocean Waves (sea state bias) Unlike the preceding effects, sea-state effects are an intrinsic property of the large footprint radar measurements. The surface scattering elements do not contribute equally to the radar return; troughs of waves tend to reflect altimeter pulses better than do crests. Thus the centroid of the mean reflecting surface is shifted away from mean sea level towards the troughs of the waves. The shift, referred to as the electromagnetic (EM) bias, causes the altimeter to overestimate the range (see Rodriguez et al., [1992]). In addition, a skewness bias also exists from the assumption in the onboard algorithms that the probability density function of heights is symmetric, while in reality it is skewed. Finally, there is a tracker bias, which is a purely instrumental effect. The sum of EM bias, skewness bias, and tracker bias is called 'sea state bias' (see sea_state_bias parameter). The accuracy of sea state bias models remains limited and continues to be a topic of research. The current most accurate estimates are obtained using empirical models derived from analyses of the altimeter data. The sea state bias is computed from a bilinear interpolation of a table of sea state biases versus significant wave height and wind speed, based on empirical fits (Labroue [2004]). Nevertheless all these works are done for Ku and C band so at the beginning of the mission, the SSB will be estimated at 3.5% of SWH and an empirical model will be computed using at least one
