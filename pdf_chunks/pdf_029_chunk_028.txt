targeted uncertainty of <20%.  It is to be noted the aerosol retrieval is very sensitive to the radiance calibration as well as to surface reflectance. An error of 1% sensor measured reflectance or in surface reflectance may lead to an uncertainty of 10% in AOD retrievals. 8.0 Future scope  The current algorithm will be extended to derive AOD at other spectral wavelengths also.  Cloud contamination in AOD retrievals at the edges of the clouds may be improved by developing a better cloud mask based on spectral analysis.  In the current version of the algorithm, the vegetation index is used to know the surface type for surface characterization from visible bands; however, pseudo-albedo may also be a potential variable for the same purpose.  A similar algorithm can be adapted for OCM-3 on-board upcoming OceanSat-3.  Knowing AOD, the aerosol correction on level-1 data can be performed for generating surface reflectance and various land products such as surface NDVI.  Since OCM-2 AOD retrieval is at a very high spatial resolution of 0.7 km, therefore these can be used for atmospheric correction of AWIFS data which will make AWIFS data more useful for agriculture and other land-use applications.  In the current version, the aerosol model is taken from the work done by Levy et al, 2007 about one decade ago based on global in-situ data from AERONET. However, there is a need for reanalysis/updating of aerosol types over different parts of the world, especially over countries like India with complex atmosphere. This will improve the aerosol retrieval accuracy and will also help in establishing the fine-mode fraction as a quantitative indicator instead of the qualitative indicator for anthropogenic aerosol sources.  This product is expected to cater inputs for radiative effects of aerosols and air-quality monitoring.
