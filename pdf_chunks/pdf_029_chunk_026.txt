interior urban centers and mainly affected by anthropogenic sources of aerosols. Over Karachi, being a coastal city, the aerosols are also affected by marine sources (sea salt) in addition to anthropogenic sources. The results are shown in figure 9. A very good correlation, of around 0.8 is observed. About 63% to 80% of AOD retrievals are within the error envelope (EE) of 20%. The results show that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive towards aerosol retrieval using VNIR observation from the OCM-2 sensor. A slight deviation of the slope of the regression line may be due to several reasons but most probably it is due to calibration error, deviation of aerosol optical properties used for inversion, and/or due to uncertainty in surface characterization in the visible channel. These factors need to be improved in future versions. 23 Figure 6. AOD map on 2 November 2016. High resolution (700m) of OCM-2 AOD enables one to capture high AOD/dust plume due to dust transportation from dust storms, which originated within India and in neighboring countries (e.g., Pakistan-Afghanistan border as shown). 24 Figure 7. High resolution (700m) from OCM-2 AOD enables one to capture high AOD/smoke plumes due to forest fires in North-East India and the neighboring countries. Figure 8. (a) AOD map over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January 2021. A very thick layer of aerosol (heavy air pollution) over IGP is observed. (b) Fine mode fraction map shows high fine aerosols in the entire IGP while relatively coarser sized particles in central India.
