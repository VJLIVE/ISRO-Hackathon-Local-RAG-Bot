rainfall. Unfortunately these relationships are neither simple nor constant; for example, because by no means all bright clouds precipitate. 2. In the thermal IR, the basic physical premise is that cloud top temperature is a function of cloud top height, and that higher and colder cloud tops evidence thicker clouds which are more likely to rain. While this set of relationship is more often true than (1) above, unfortunately not all cold clouds precipitate, nor does rain always come from cold clouds. Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determines its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is related to its physical temperature is T by following equation: Tb =  T where,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a white body; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque
