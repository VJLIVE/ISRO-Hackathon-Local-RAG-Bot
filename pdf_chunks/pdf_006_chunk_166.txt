Channel number Central wavelength (μm) Purpose 1 0.65 Sun glint and coastal false alarm rejection; cloud masking. 2 0.86 Bright surface, sun glint, and coastal false alarm rejection; cloud masking. 7 2.1 Sun glint and coastal false alarm rejection. 21 4.0 High-range channel for active fire detection. 22 4.0 Low-range channel for active fire detection. 31 11.0 Active fire detection, cloud masking. 32 12.0 Cloud masking. (Source: Giglio, et al, 2003) 8.6.2 Methods of validation  Validation through comparison with images acquired over forest fire events from other sensors.  Validation through temporal monitoring.  Verification by ground truth data. 8.7 Technical issues (limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product will depend on the accuracy of the input radiance. Further some limitations in the present study are listed as: (i) It is assumed that an adequate knowledge of the background temperature prevailing in India in all season and geographic regions are known and correct. (ii) False fire alarm will be mostly controlled. However, fine tuning in first year of operation may be required.
