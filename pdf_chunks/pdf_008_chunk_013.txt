of IMD Weekly WWR met-subdivision accumulated rain for 7 weeks with corresponding H-E rain averaged over 4 typical high orographic met-subdivisions, viz. Arunachal Pradesh (AP), Uttrakhand (UK), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), The Fig. 6 shows that H-E rain estimated for areas with high altitudes is largely underestimated with respect to surface observations. Also, with regard to Fig. 1, as it is already mentioned in section 3.0 that the rain over Himalayan region is not well depicted by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as that provided by NOAA using Meteosat. In view of the observed underestimation of the rain by H-E in the present form over high altitude regions, it is desired to investigate its possible reason and accordingly modify the H-E method to make it able to better represent the rain over high altitudes. (b) (c) (a) SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 11 Fig. 6: Comparison of IMD weekly rain from WWR with corresponding H-E rain in 4 met subdivisions with high altitudes. 5.0 Modified Hydro-estimator: As discussed the previous section, the H-E is not able to give satisfactory measurements over high altitudinal regions. This weakness of H-E is noticeable despite of the fact that the H-E method is designed with corrections for orography and warm rain. Herein we reinvestigated different corrections applied to the H-E method to work out procedures to make it better representative of surface observations, especially in high altitudes. Fig. 7: NCEP GFS model derived (a) TPW and (b) RH for a typical day and time. Correction of NCEP derived TPW and RH It was observed in the NCEP GFS analyzed fields that TPW and RH values are very low in the Himalayan region. For example, Fig. 7 shows the TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage) for a typical day and time,
