both channels are same that is O is approximately equal to O. With this assumption we are left with only one unknown in Eq (8) and that can be easily estimated. After retrieving the value of cloud top pressure using a-priori information of UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d) in eq (8), effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is computed using eq (9) INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 115 NO = D(E)DFGj(E) H[E,K(LF)]DFGj(E) ------------------- (9) where N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, NO the effective cloud amount,  is the window channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to window channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel. It is evident from the equation (9) that effective cloud amount or effective cloud emissivity is multiplication of N (fractional cloud cover within the FOV) and  (Cloud emissivity), therefore, effective cloud amount can be less than 1 because of: broken cloud (N<1, =1) has filled the FOV overcast transmissive cloud (N=1, <1) broken transmissive cloud (N<1, <1) Therefore, it is difficult to quantify exactly the emissivity of clouds using the effective cloud amounts from approximately 50 km x 50 km INSAT-3D/3DR sounder products. The cloud top products from CO2 slicing technique are matched with other methods to filter out any other clouds that are not upper level clouds. Upper level clouds are flagged by using the combination of highly absorbing channels (such as water vapor absorption channel in 6.7 µm or CO2 absorption channel in 15 µm band) and channels with less absorption. In general, the brightness temperatures in strong absorption channels are much cooler than the brightness temperatures (BT) in weak absorption channels for clear atmospheric condition or low level clouds. Contrary to this, for high level clouds
