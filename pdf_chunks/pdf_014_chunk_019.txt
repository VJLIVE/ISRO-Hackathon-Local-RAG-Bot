cover mapping, sensitivity tests of individual threshold values were carried out. Sensitivity analysis will be carry out to identify NDSI threshold for INSAT 3D(R) snow products. This threshold value will also be verified using FFC combination for snow covered area identification. 1.4.2.6. Fraction Snow Cover Snow binary product of INSAT 3D data, available at coarse resolution, will be used to convert into fractional snow cover which will be helpful to improve the snow cover areal extent based on occupancy of that pixel in terms of actual snow fraction present in respective pixel of INSAT 3D. Synchronous INSAT and high resolution satellite derive NDSI and snow cover product were selected for the winter season. Different months and terrain in Himalayan region was chosen to represent to take care possible scenarios. INSAT derived NDSI and snow pixel was compared with NDSI and snow pixel for high resolution data to develop a relationship between NDSI and snow cover areal extent for coarse and fine resolution datasets. This develop relationship will be used to generate fractional snow cover area for INSAT dataset and will be helpful to improve daily snow cover areal extent from geostationary platform. 1.4.3. Operational Implementation Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: In this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D(R) data. The radiometrically processed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and geometrically corrected product to be used further in algorithm. Step 2 : Cloud elimination This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D(R) image. Cloud screening is based on SWIR reflectance/temperature data, or cloud mask product will be used subject to its availability, and this will help to clear cloudy pixels. Step 3 : Generation
