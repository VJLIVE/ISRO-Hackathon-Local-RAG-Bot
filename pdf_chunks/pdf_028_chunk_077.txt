the same transmitter- receiver geometry in the absence of the atmosphere. The first order relativistic contributions to the Doppler are identical in the two situations and cancel out. Equation (1) holds for atmosphere of any shape. However, (1) also has infinite number of solutions, since kt and kr are unknown, corresponding to four independent parameters. Therefore, certain assumptions have to be made on the shape of the atmosphere in order to derive the atmospheric bending from equation (1).To a good approximation, the neutral atmosphere is spherically symmetric. In order to account for the ellipticity of the Earth, the center of symmetry is taken to correspond to the circle of occultation plane which best fits the geoid near the tangent point. With the spherical symmetry assumption, equation (1) reduces to two equations in two unknowns ) cos cos ( )) cos( ) cos( ( r r t t r r r t t t v v v v dt d              2(a) ) sin( ) sin( r r r r t t t t n r n r a         2(b) Equation 2(b) is Bouger’s law (equivalent to Snell’s law in a spherically symmetric medium). rr and rt are the vectors from the center of curvature to transmitter and receiver, respectively; rr =| rr|, rt=| rt| and nr and nt are indices of refraction at the transmitter and receiver, respectively.

Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 70 At the heights of the transmitter (~ 20000 km) and receiver (low earth orbit), the indices of refraction are assumed to be equal to 1. This approximation can be shown to introduce a very small
