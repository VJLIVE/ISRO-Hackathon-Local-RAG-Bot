The k2 Love number used in this conversion was 0.3. The geoid undulations are given with respect to an ideal geocentric mean Earth ellipsoid, whose semi-major axis remains undefined (i.e., there is no zero-degree term in the spherical harmonic series of these geoid undulations). The flattening of this reference ellipsoid is f=1/298.257 so that values are consistent with constants adopted for T/P. Since the geoid undulations have been computed from an expansion to degree 360, the resolution of the undulations will be on the order of 50km. Data used to derived the EGM96 model include surface gravity data from different regions of the globe, altimeter derived gravity anomalies from the GEOSAT Geodetic Mission, altimeter derived anomalies from ERS-1, direct satellite altimetry from T/P, ERS-1 and GEOSAT, and satellite tracking to over 20 satellites using satellite laser ranging, GPS, DORIS, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), and TRANET.

Bathymetry The value of this parameter is determined from the DTM2000.1 model from N. Pavlis and J. Saleh [personal communication, 2000] of the Raytheon ITSS/Goddard Space Flight Center. The model is provided globally with a 2' resolution. The heritage of DTM2000.1 goes back to the OSUJAN98 database [Pavlis and Rapp, 1990] and the JGP95E database [Chapter 2 of Lemoine et al., 1998]. The bathymetric information in DTM2000.1 (originating from Smith and Sandwell's [1994] global sea floor topography) has significant differences with the ETOPO5 bathymetric model. The mean and standard deviation of these differences is 10 m and 270 m, respectively. 3.2.6. Ocean Tides
