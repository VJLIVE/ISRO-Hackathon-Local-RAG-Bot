have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose. Snow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component characteristic of forward scattering increases. 6.2.2 Objective The purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. Daily snow and maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated. This algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively (Romanov et al, 2003). 6.3 Inputs and output data 6.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values Visible (0.52-0.75 m) & SWIR (1.55-1.70 m) pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Snow cover INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 104 Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-1 channel (10.2- 11.2 m) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Geolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP 6.3.2 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs Source Product Frequency Role in algorithm Purpose AWiFS Land cover map Each product Modify NDSI value Improve accuracy Reflectance library Reflectance in visible and SWIR region As per requirement NDSI threshold value before launch Development and
