AERONEt (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a network of ground-based sun photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben of Code 923 of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS. The sun-photometers measure the spectral aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In India 4 AERONET sites namely Jaipur, Kanpur, Gandhi College, and Amity University Noida; in Bangladesh 2 sites namely Bhola and Dhaka University; in Pakistan Lahore and Karachi, and few sites in Nepal and Myanmar are providing systematic in-situ AOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of OCM-2 derived AODs after proper co-location in space and time. For co-location of AERONET data with OCM-2 AOD retrievals, the in-situ AOD measurements will be averaged in a ±30 minute window centered at the time of OCM-2 AOD retrievals. It is to be noted that different AERONET stations may have a different temporal resolution of the in-situ measurement, therefore, along with overall validation, the variation in validation results when using in-situ data at different temporal resolution will also be studied. 6.2.2 Handheld sun photometer validation Many of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to
