to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by IMD’s regional model. c) Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment To use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn- around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications. d) Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of cloud-tracers. The comparison has been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.
