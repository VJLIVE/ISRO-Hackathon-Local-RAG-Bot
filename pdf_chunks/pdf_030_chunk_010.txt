of Chilika Lagoon (see Fig. 5) indicate significant differences among the SA models when compared with in situ measurements. The mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of pooled data set for Lee–Morel and GSM was above 150% while ABOM showed significant improvement in reducing the MAPD to 58%. From Table I, it is clear that mean chl-a (10.2 mg/m3) for ABOM model is very close to mean in situ chl-a (11.05 mg/m3) unlike to Lee–Morel (27.7 mg/m3) and GSM (33.1 mg/m3). In addition to that, a significant improvement in the ABOM model in terms of relative bias (6.92%) was observed over Lee–Morel (188.2%) and GSM (167.8%). Slope S of CDM (colored dissolved and detrital matter combined) used in Lee–Morel is determined dynamically based on an empirical relationship with blue–green ratio.

Validation of chl-a derived from ABOM (this study), GSM and Lee–Morel models with in situ data set. However, the parametrization causes the slope to be always greater than 0.015 (1/nm). In optically complex waters, the contribution of CDOM and detrital matter to absorption in blue wavelengths is significant and independent. Higher absorption in reference wavelength due to CDOM significantly decreases the slope value (less than 0.01, this study). Therefore, Lee–Morel does not accurately estimate chlorophyll concentration when CDOM is high. In GSM model, the slope value of CDOM absorption is kept constant and high (0.02 nm−1) which also creates a strong bias resulting in overestimation of chlorophyll concentration. The ABOM model accounts for the low magnitude in slope values for higher CDOM absorption in optically complex
