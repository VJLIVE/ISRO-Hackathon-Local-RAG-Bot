used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. However our recent sensitivity study has suggested that the environmental correction factor (PWRH) is more suitable for larger scale rainfall (such as in GPI within 10 x10) than for (IMSRA within or less than 0.10x0.10). This factor now has not been invoked on IMSRA algorithm any more.

Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses INSAT TIR, WV Data Half Hourly Image Conversion from Grey Count to TBs Look Up Table for Calibration Grid Average of IR TBs Collocation of IR TBs and Microwave Estimation of Rainfall from IR Thermal IR Brightness Temp. 11 and 6.7 micron Satellite Microwave Rainfall (TRMM/PR) Grid Avg.

The algorithm have the number of steps which are already encorporated and described in Gairola et al. (2007). Based on a number of case studies and research works carried out during last few years, some
