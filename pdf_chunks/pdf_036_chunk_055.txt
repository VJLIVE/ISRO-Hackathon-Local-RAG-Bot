noise level (to be removed from the waveform samples) “Sea Ice” retracking In this algorithm, waveform parameterisation based on peak threshold retracking is applied to the Ka-band waveform. From this parameterisation, a tracking offset and backscatter estimate are determined. Tests are made on the extent of the tracking offset, and extreme values are flagged as retracking failures. The sea-ice waveform amplitude is determined by finding the maximum value of the waveform samples and the tracking offset is determined by finding the point on the waveform (by interpolation) where the waveform amplitude exceeds a threshold determined from the above sea-ice amplitude. A tracking offset is determined. The Centre Of Gravity offset correction must be included in the range measurement as the correction is not available separately in the L2 product. - Amplitude ⇒ Sigma0 - Tracking offset ⇒ altimeter range - Centre Of Gravity offset correction ⇒ correction to altimeter range measurement Altimeter Instrument Corrections Consistent with MLE4 retracking algorithm SARAL/AltiKa Radiometer Parameters Using on-board calibration Dry Troposphere Range Correction From ECMWF atmospheric pressures and model for S1 and S2 atmospheric tides Wet Troposphere Range Correction from Model From ECMWF model Ionosphere correction Based on Global Ionosphere TEC Maps from JPL Sea State Bias 3.5% of SWH values Mean Sea Surface MSS_CNES-CLS11 SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 38 Model Product Version "T” and “d” Mean Dynamic Topography MDT_CNES-CLS09 Geoid EGM96 Bathymetry Model DTM2000.1 Inverse Barometer Correction Computed from ECMWF atmospheric pressures after removing S1 and S2 atmospheric tides Non-tidal High-frequency Dealiasing Correction Mog2D High Resolution ocean model on (I)GDRs.
