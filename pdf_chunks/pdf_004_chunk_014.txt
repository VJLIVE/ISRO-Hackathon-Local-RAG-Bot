global observations of radar backscatter from Oceansat-2 scatterometer and near concurrent model analysis wind vector data. In order to develop GMF for rain free conditions, near concurrent observations of rain is also required from other satellites like TRMM-PR/TMI and DMSP-SSM-I. The collection of these data sets is planned for about six months from the launch of Oceansat-2 satellite. The justification for six month period is that a sufficient data base is required to be prepared to cover the widest range of wind speed as well as the entire range of wind direction for all wind speed preferably the low and high speed ranges also pertaining to rain free situations. The data required for GMF development is reflected in Table (3). 12 Table 3: Ancillary data for Oceansat-2 scatterometer GMF development: Source Sensor Parameter Oceansat-2/ Scatterometer Backscatter & ancil. data Satellite TRMM-PR/TMI and SSM-I Rain rate Global Models ECMWF/ NCEP/ NCMRWF Model analysis Wind speed and dir, SST, surface air temp. and humidity Insitu NIOT/ NIO/ -ICOADS /TRITON buoys, AWS and ship cruise data Wind speed and dir 5.0 Wind vector retrieval and the state of art: The radar backscatter having harmonic dependence on wind direction yields multiple solutions of wind vector from a given set of radar backscatter measurements. As the radar backscatter is a function of wind speed and direction, two measurements of radar backscatter are essentially required to determine wind vector. However, unique solutions are not possible due to the harmonic nature of backscatter on wind direction and the presence of noise in radar data. Among these multiple wind vector solutions, only one solution corresponds to true wind vector while others are ambiguities also known as “ aliases”. Although, the wind speed solutions are very close to each other, the direction solutions are quite apart. The solutions are
