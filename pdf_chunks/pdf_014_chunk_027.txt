fact that the total amount of energy released per unit mass of dry fuel fully burned is weakly dependent on vegetation types and fuel types, which ranges between 16 and 22 MJ/kg (Lobert and Warnatz, 1993; Whelan, 1995; Trollope et al., 1996; Wooster et al., 2005). Thus, biomass burning emission is linearly linked to fire radiative energy in a simple formula (Wooster, 2002): ……………………..(2) Where; FRP = fire radiative power (MW); FRE = fire radiative energy (MJ); t1 and t2 = beginning and ending time (second) of a fire event; β = biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) F = emission factor (g/kg for CO and PM2.5) FRE represents the combination of total burned area and the dry fuel mass combusted (e.g., live foliage, branches, dead leaf litter, and woody materials) in a given time period, which reduces error sources of parameter measurements comparing with the first approach (eq.1) employing both burned area and fuel loading in the estimates of biomass burning emissions. Thus, the FRP approach will be better to produce BBEP. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 28 2.3.1 Algorithm flowchart (FRP approach) Once a fire is identified, Fire Radiative Power (FRP) estimation algorithm will be applied. FRP is theoretically a function of fire size and fire temperature. It is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) band (Kaufman et al., 1998). Further, FRP is approximated as the difference of MIR spectral radiances between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels in a linear form (Wooster et al., 2003). The proposed method is based on the assumption that Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) channel.
