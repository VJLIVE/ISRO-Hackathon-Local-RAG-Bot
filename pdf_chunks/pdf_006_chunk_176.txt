it has been found that combining CLD with conventional multi-threshold test also improves the robustness of smoke detection. Thus pixels are further required to pass the following test, 1 CLD C  (4) where ‘C1’ is the threshold value for smoke plumes. If a pixel passes all these 5 tests, surrounding pixels are checked to screen out cloud edge pixels.A flow diagram is given to illustrate the flow of the smoke detection algorithm. Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 147 9.4.1.2 Flow Chart Figure 1: FLOW DIAGRAM FOR SMOKE DETECTION ALGORITHM 9.4.2 Operational retrieval implementation The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: 1. Conversion of gray counts to radiance and brightness temperatures 2. Conversion of gray counts to Albedo for the VIS channel This is done with the help of conversion tables. 3. Calculation of solar reflectance angle To exclude sun glint processing path is taken for solar reflectance angle  r greater than threshold value (approximately 20deg)[4], where where  is the viewing zenith angle,  is the azimuth angle and, 0 is the Solar Zenith Angle. 4. Defining of thresholds Using training dataset of forest fires over the Indian region for VIS, MIR , TIR-1 and TIR-2 channels, thresholds have to be defined for tests listed above. The methodology Smoke INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 148 to be followed is to first assume initial value of thresholds based on literature and then fine tune them, using visual inspection. 5. Implementation of five pass tests 6. Cloud edge detection algorithm A difference image is produced from 10.7 and 3.9-μm channels and an adjacent pixel test is performed to detect cloud edges. 9.5 Output Generation of smoke map 9.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Output: lat , lon, Smoke flag Smoke flag: 1
