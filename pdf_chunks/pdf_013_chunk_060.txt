2014) 4.4.2. Soil heat flux model Statitsical approach The ratio of daytime soil heat flux and net radiation from AMS measurements over short vegetative systems were found to produce logarithmic relation with INSAT 3A CCD NDVI at 1 km. This relation was used to derive the soil heat flux (Bhattacharya et. al . 2014). Figure 2: Relationship of net radiation fraction of soil heat flux (G) with NDVI INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 53 It resulted into a significant correlation coefficient of 0.8. The spread is relatively more which could be due to difference in situ measurement footprints of soil heat flux and net radiation, and INSAT 3A CCD. This function was used to estimate soil heat flux through inversion from regional daytime net radiation and INSAT NDVI. This relation G = -12.5 ln(NDVI)-1.317 will be used to compute the G/Rn ratio. Using all-sky net radiation product from INSAT 3DR and sliding monthly NDVI composite from other sources, daytime G and net available energy can be computed. Since nighttime soil heat flux is very negligible, daytime G will be scaled to daily 24 hours average G to derive daily ɸ. Thermal inertia-based (TI) physical modelling approach The physical model for the land surface soil heat flux estimate based on the harmonic analysis of soil surface temperature (HM model) is described by Murray and Verhoef et.al. (2007) as follows: G = Γ *( ( 1 - ) * +, )* (∑ ./√/ώ 1 ) sin(nώt + ɸn + 2 3 − 2Δ5 )* )) = Γ * Js (7) where G (W m−2) is the at-surface soil heat flux, Γ (J m−2 K−1 s−0.5) is the soil thermal inertia, M is the total number of harmonics used An is the amplitude of the n’th soil surface temperature (Ts) harmonic, ω
