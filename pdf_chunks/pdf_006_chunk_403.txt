0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS operational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast retrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with lysimeter data and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean. Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS equipped with humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 331 FAO-56 P-M method. They used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al. 2004). The study found that most of the errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to uncertainties in retrieving daily solar radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 1.32 mm (11% to 110% from daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of ETo mean value) at 0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ETo mean value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational product of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05Â°grid for estimation of ETo at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from measured mean) but it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and further in monthly scale (21% from monthly mean). The overall error at different temporal domain were found in good harmony with reported errors in other part of world. 19.8 Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues The following sources of uncertainties
