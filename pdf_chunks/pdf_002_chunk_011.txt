probability distribution of brightness temperatures for rainy and non-rain cases, separately for all 182 pixel 6 locations (please note that Fig. 1 (a) â€“ (f) is just an example for pixel location # 45 over the oceans), and calculate the average probability of a given pixel as rainy (PR) and non-rainy (PNR). We normalize the PR and PNR to make their sum unity. Now, we examine the PR (or PNR) by plotting distribution of PR from all pixel locations calculated separately from rainy and non-rainy SAPHIR-PR collocated training datasets (Fig. 2a) for ocean and Fig (2b) for the land. The distribution of PR from non-rainy dataset is shown as line joining open circles and that for rainy dataset is shown as line joining open triangles. We still find a large overlap between two plots in Fig.2 (a), (b). However, we notice a long tail in the distribution of PR associated with non-rainy dataset and a double peak in the distribution associated with rainy dataset. Thus it is possible that in the SAPHIR-PR collocated dataset a large number of pixels which are considered as non-raining are actually rainy and vice versa. This could be possible as collocation in space and time is not perfect as discussed above. There may also be some problem in the collocation due to other reasons like sensitivity of PR (~0.7 mm/h) (anonymous, 2011), angle of observation, etc. Thus, we do not take PR=0.5 as the threshold value to identify rain/no-rain and a more appropriate value of the PR threshold is worked out. We examined different threshold values of PR and tried to identify most appropriate value of PR which is optimized for minimal error in the identification of rain/no-rain. This procedure led us to find a PR value of 0.6 as most appropriate value for ocean
