Here for cloud detection algorithm a 3x3 pixel field-of-regard (FOR) is used. The FOR is moved by 1 pixel sequentially in E-W and N-S (along and across the scan-line) to maximize the clear FOR detection. Two types of cloud flags are generated one each for the FOV (single pixel) and FOR (3 x 3 pixel box). In present algorithm the output contains three types of cloud-flags that are given by: 0: Clear 1: Cloudy 2: Partially cloudy The cloud detection procedure is carried out in three steps to filters out cloudy pixels very accurately and efficiently: (a). The first step is a very gross check and is applied on a FOR of 3x3 pixel box. If it fails in the first check then the whole FOR is declared as cloudy and it moves to the next FOR. In case of passing the first step a series of tests are applied on the FOR in second step. In third and final step, a series of tests are applied on each FOV and the results of these tests decide the final outcome. (b). Primary Array Flag (PAF): This is first step
