first to suggest that atmospheric temperature profiles could be inferred from satellite observations of thermal infrared emission and explained the feasibility of retrieving the temperature profile from the satellite intensity scan measurements. Further advances were made for the temperature-sounding concept when Kaplan demonstrated (1959) that vertical profile of temperature could be inferred from the spectral distribution of emission by atmospheric gases. He suggested that observations in the wings of a spectral band sense deeper regions of the atmosphere; whereas observations in the band center see only the very top layer of the atmosphere. Thus by properly selecting a set of sounding spectral channels at different wavelengths in the absorption band, the observed radiances could be used to estimate the vertical temperature profile in the atmosphere. Following a proposal by Wark (1961) for satellite vertical sounding program to measure atmospheric temperature profiles, the first satellite-sounding instrument (SIRS-A) was launched on NIMBUS-3 in 1969 (Wark et al., 1970). NOAA launched the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder in 1978 (TOVS, Smith et al. 1979), consisting of High- resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), and the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) onboard satellites NOAA-6 to NOAA-14. HIRS provides 17 km spatial resolution at nadir with 19 infrared sounding channels (4-15), whereas MSU provides 109 km resolution at nadir with 4 microwave channels (~50 GHz). SSU has 3 channels in the far IR (~15) for stratospheric measurements. Current NOAA series satellites NOAA-15 and NOAA-16 (and future satellite in the NOAA series) have ATOVS with HIRS/3, and MSU and SSU have been replaced by AMSU-A and AMSU-B to improve the temperature and humidity sounding. HIRS/3 has the same spectral bands as the HIRS/2. AMSU-A uses 15 microwave channels around 23, 30, 50 and 90 GHz of oxygen absorption bands with resolution of 50 km at
