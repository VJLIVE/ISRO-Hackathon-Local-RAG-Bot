Shortwave Infrared Channel 6 19. SND_VIS Gray Counts of Visible Channel 10 Each of these datasets has following attributes giving meta-information about each channel: Table 2.8 Attributes of Datasets within Channel Datasets S. No. Attribute Name Data type Description Applicable Levels 1. long_name string, length=variable Descriptive name of the channel L1B, L1C 2. invert string, length=4 or 5 Whether the channel is inverted or not. Possible values=true or false. All IR/WV channels are inverted. L1B, L1C 3. bandwidth 32-bit floating point Bandwidth of channel (same units as that of central wavelength) L1B, L1C 4. central_wavelen gth 32-bit floating point Central wavelength L1B, L1C 5. wavelength_unit string, length=2 Units of central wavelength L1B, L1C 6. bits_per_pixel 32-bit integer Bits per pixel of the data L1B, L1C 7. resolution 32-bit floating point Spatial Resolution at NADIR in case of L1B and for full image in case of L1C L1B, L1C 8. resolution_unit string, length=2 Units of Spatial resolution L1B, L1C 9. coordinates string, length=variable CF-compliant attribute for associating coordinate variables with the data variable. For example “time latitude longitude” L1B 10. grid_mapping string, length=variable CF-compliant attribute for associating coordinate variables with the data variable. For example “mercator” for Mercator Projection.
