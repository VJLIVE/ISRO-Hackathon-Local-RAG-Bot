level. For high orographic regions, this needs to be modified and replaced with realistic level. This is done in the modified algorithm; we can see the 850 mb u-wind component on a typical date and time in Fig. 12 (a), and modified wind input to orographic correction in Fig. 12 (b). One can see the moderate changes in the wind only over orographic regions. Fig. 12: From NCEP model fields (a) Wind Speed at 850 mb (b) Wind Speed above boundary layer.

We have presented a detailed validation of the modified H-E over all the other regions too. 6.0 Validation of Modified Hydro-Estimator The above modifications in H-E are aimed at improving rain over orographic regions. Hence the success of the changes in the H-E depends primarily on its improved performance over Hilly terrain, and its consistent or improved performance over all other regions. We have taken two different cases of intense rain over Himalyas which were poorly represented by H-E. One is that of flash floods in Uttrakhand from 15-17 June 2013 which resulted heavy flooding and huge loss of life and property. In June 2013, INSAT-3D was not available and hence we applied the modified algorithm to Kalpana-1 VHRR observations and examined the performance. Figure 13 shows the rain over Uttrakhand region in the morning of 17 June 2013 when scores or people were perished in Kedarnath, Badrinath and other adjoining regions. The Fig. 13 (a) is H-E rain measurements without applying modifications and Fig. 13 (b) shows the H-E rain with modifications as described in section 5.0. We can see the mark difference in the rain intensity with
