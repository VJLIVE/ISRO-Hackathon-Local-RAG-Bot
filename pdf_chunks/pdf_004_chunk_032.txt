More so, the computational efficiency of the present algorithm is found to be higher (about 2 to 3 times) as compared to that of MLE algorithm during simulation studies as well as testing with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 2006). 6.0 Flagging: Retrieval of ocean surface wind vector from scatterometer is affected in the presence of rain due to modification of measured radar backscatter in two ways. During rain, the drops falling on water surface create crater, crown, stalk and ring waves. Out of these, ring waves contribute the most towards radar backscatter through Bragg resonance. Besides, rain attenuates the radar signal as well as contributes through volume backscattering. A study of rain impact on backscatter and associated wind vector retrieval is required for rain flagging of backscatter data. Due to the directional symmetry of ring waves and the scattering from water drops in rain column the backscatter signals are depolarized causing diminishing difference of radar backscatter in vertical and horizontal polarizations. However, high intensity winds under rain-free conditions also lead to depolarization. The normalized polarization difference is found to have a potential for pre-retrieval rain flagging. Under moderate and high rain conditions, pre-retrieval rain flagging is feasible. Light rain and high wind conditions lead to false/missing rain flagging. The impact of rain is also observed in terms of drastic changes in retrieved wind speed and direction. Retrieval of wind vector under raining conditions is highly erroneous and mostly renders retrieval meaningless. This needs rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged out). In the present study, only rain flagging of data using the retrieval algorithm by Gohil et al (2006) has been attempted following procedures given by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success rates for rain-free and rainy conditions. The rain-flagging scheme has been tested with simulated data
