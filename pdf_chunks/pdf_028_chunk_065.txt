radiances. Three important steps involved in the ScaRaB radiance to flux computation are: 1. Spectral correction 2. Scene Identification and 3. Flux computation (by applying scene-type dependent ADM). 5.2.1.1 Spectral Correction The calibrations of the filtered radiances LTf and LSWf are normalized to precise radiation sources: blackbodies at temperature respectively 310 K and 5800 K. Then the unfiltered radiances are equal to filtered radiances only if the observed targets have similar or proportional emission spectra. Otherwise the unfiltered radiances are calculated from the filtered radiances scene f scene scene F L L ï€½ -- (1) where Fscene is the filtering factor, varying around 1 according to the spectral shape or colour of the scene. 5.2.1.2 Scene Identification Unlike the CERES instrument on TRMM, Aqua and Terra missions, the ScaRaB/MeghaTropiques will not have an imager payload for scene identification. To identify the scene, the indirect ERBE scene identification method (Wieliecki et al., 1989) will be utilized. This is a statistical approach Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 57 called Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) technique and uses only the unfiltered LLW and LSW radiances measured by ScaRaB for scene identification. 5.2.1.2.1 ERBE Angular Model Both the scene identification and the flux computation use the ERBE Angular Dependence Model (ADM) generated by Suttles et al. (1989). From statistical analysis of satellite measurement (mainly seven months of Nimbus 7 radiance measurements), the radiance anisotropy is described for 12 scene types, combination of 5 geo-types and 4 cloud cover categories (Table 2). In the LW, the ADM depends on latitude and season. The ADM are not continuous functions of the angles, but discrete values corresponding to the angular intervals.
