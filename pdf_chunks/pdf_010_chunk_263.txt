wind coverage typically decreases sharply when visible channel is not available. This creates a situation of overall reduced wind information for the user during night-time. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) 3.9 μm channel on the INSAT-3D satellite, MIR cloud-drift winds have been developed to provide improved nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage. The MIR channel is slightly more sensitive to warmer temperatures and less sensitive to thin cirrus than the 10.7 μm long- wave infrared (LWIR) channel traditionally used to track low-level clouds at night. This allows for a higher detectability rate of low-level (600-950 hPa) cloud tracers in the MIR channel. Improved low-level nighttime wind coverage can provide forecasters with more wind data as well as reduce the diurnal inconsistencies that may be a challenge to data assimilation into models. 14.2.2 Objective The main objective of this study is to derive the Mid-Infrared Winds (MIR) over sea using multiple successive half hourly MIR images. The region over which the winds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point. 14.3 Inputs 14.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Source Continental boundary Data 1 km DP (IMD data) 14.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of split window IR channel (10.5-11.5 m and 11.5-12.5 m) and MIR channel (3.9 m) (All the data is required in fixed lat-lon grid for continuous 8-images separated by 30 minutes time interval) pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Geo-location file Pixel - 1 Km Derived by DP Mid infra-red wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 217 14.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Numerical model forecast of wind for
