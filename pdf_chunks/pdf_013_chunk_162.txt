because they don’t get “support”. Hundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, if we take three satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 02:30 UTC to 03:30 UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example, winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires four images. Similarly, the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 13.5. Operational Implementation Step 1: Tracer selection from image  Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 143 Step 2: Height assignment  Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height. 
