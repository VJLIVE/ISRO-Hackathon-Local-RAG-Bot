in the radiative transfer model. Improved fast radiative transfer models may be coupled with the physical retrieval routine in future, as and when available. Improvements will also be attempted by incorporating improved training dataset in regression retrieval. Another area for future development is improvement of cloud detection algorithm. This may include synergy of high-resolution Imager data with Sounder observations to detect sub-pixel level cloud contamination. Initially, the retrieval will be attempted only over cloud-free FOVs. In future, an algorithm will be developed and implemented with retrieval routine to compute the cloud-cleared radiances over partially cloudy pixels. Retrieval of profiles in overcast conditions (valid above cloud top) will also be attempted in near future. This algorithm will also be useful for future hyper-spectral missions with suitable modifications. 16.9 References 1. Ackerman, S. A., K. I. Strabala, W. P. Menzel, R. A. Frey, C. C. Moeller, and L.
