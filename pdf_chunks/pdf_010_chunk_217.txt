Satellite (GMS)-5 have been produced since 1995, and clear-sky WV segments have been separated since 1998 (Tokuno 1996, 1998). Tokuno et al. (2002) state that the appropriate height assignment of clear-sky WV motion vectors is still an unresolved task. Geo-stationary satellites of the Fengyun-2 series are operated by the National Satellite Meteorological Center of China since 1997 (Xu et al. 1998). These satellites are equipped with a water vapor channel as well. The method to evaluate atmospheric motion vectors compromises new features (Xu et al. 2002) that are unconventional relative to the earlier schemes applied to the data from Meteosat or GOES. The study Buche et al. (2006) has shown improvement in Water Vapor structure displacements both in smooth and shallow scenes by using proper filters. He then tested a series of height assignment methods using altitude-based parameters such as wind shear and brightness contrast of pixels. This study reveals that for the cases of strong wind shear the methods that use the effective brightness temperature from the coldest pixels lead to better height assignments than do others that are based on the contribution function explicitly. 12.2.2 Objective The main objective of this study is to derive the water vapor wind vectors over land and sea using multiple half hourly Water Vapor images. The region over which the winds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point. 12.3 Inputs 12.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Source Continental boundary data 4 km DP (IMD data) Land Sea mask 8 km Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 184 12.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of WV channel (6.7) pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Radiometric and geometric corrected gray
