1.1. The main fields recomputed for GDR with respect to IGDR are the following: • Due to the update of orbit data: Latitude (“latitude”) Longitude (“longitude”) Altitude (“alt”,”orb_state_flag_rest”, “alt_40hz”) Orbital altitude rate (“orb_alt_rate”) Sum of the instrumental corrections (“net_instr_corr_range”) Corrected ground retracked altimeter ranges (“range) Ionospheric correction (“iono_corr_gim”) SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 62 • Due to the update of platform data: Distance antenna-COG correction (“cog_corr”) Sum of the instrumental corrections (“net_instr_corr_range”) Corrected ground retracked altimeter ranges (“range”) Ionospheric correction (“iono_corr_gim”) • Due to the update of pole locations: Pole tide height (“pole_tide”) • Due to the update of Mog2D data: High frequency dealiasing correction (“hf_fluctuations_corr”) • Due to the update of radiometer calibration coefficients: All the radiometer-derived parameters, and mainly as far as altimeter parameters are concerned: Radiometer wet tropospheric correction (“rad_wet_tropo_corr”) Atmospheric attenuation (“atmos_corr_sig0”) Backscatter coefficient (“sig0”) Altimeter wind speed (“wind_speed_alt”) Sea State Bias (“sea_state_bias”) Rain flag (“rain_flag”) Ice flag (“ice_flag”) 6.1. Data format SARAL/AltiKa OGDR, IGDR and GDR products have the same information and format. The only difference is related to the auxiliary data used (orbit, meteo files, calibrations, … ). Accounting for Jason-2 heritage, products are split into three data sets : • “SSHA” data set : One file close to Jason-2 NRT-SSHA, limited to 1Hz sampling values • “GDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 IGDR, containing 1Hz and 40Hz values • “SGDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 SGDR, containing 1Hz, 40hz and waveforms values The following figure shows the data sets available for each kind of product.
