cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004). This technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and availability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. In this technique combination of visual and digital analysis technique was used. This was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult to used only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 117 supervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). Another important difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern and it can not be seen, when area is covered by cloud cover. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 ÔÅ≠m has been successfully used to separate some types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006). 7.2.1.2 Estimation of Snow Reflectance in Himalaya In order
