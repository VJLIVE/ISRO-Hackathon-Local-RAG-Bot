air temperature (oC) The above FAO Penman and Monteith equation is a close representation of the physical and physiological factors governing the evapotranspiration process. To compute ETo from FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approach following intermediate inputs are calculated as follows: 19.4.1 Saturation vapour pressure (es) As saturation vapour pressure (SVP) is related to air temperature, it can be calculated as:        3. 237 27 . 17 exp 6108 .0 T T T eo ) (T eo = Saturation vapour pressure ) (kPa at the air temperature T T = air temperature (oC) 19.4.2 Slope of saturation vapour pressure curve (∆) The relationship between saturation vapour pressure (SVP) and temperature , is required.
