low rain rates of < 0.25 mm/h. Again the SAPHIR rain is determined using the rain retrieval algorithm discussed in the next section. The Fig. 5 shows that rain area by SAPHIR matches fairly well with that from 3B42. 3. Rain Retrieval In the previous section, rain identification in SAPHIR observations is discussed. In this section, we make an attempt to retrieve the rain. For development of the retrieval algorithm, we first tried to examine the expected behavior of SAPHIR frequency channels with rain. For that we use radiative transfer simulations, we simulate brightness temperatures using a scattering based microwave radiative transfer model (MWRT) developed by Liu (1998) for all the six channels of SAPHIR. In these model simulations, we use a standard tropical atmospheric profile over calm oceans with surface temperature of 300 K. Figure 6 (a) shows plot of the brightness temperature versus rain rate for a typical scan position of for all the six channels of SAPHIR. Here, it may be observed that channel 1 (S1) i.e., at 183.31±0.2 GHz, exhibits the minimum slope and is thus least affected, and channel 6 (S6) i.e., at 183.31±11.0 GHz, exhibits the maximum slope and is thus most affected by the rain This is in agreement with many previous studies (e.g. Eymard et al., 2001, Bennartz and Bauer, 2003, etc.). Next, we have taken the difference of these two channels and tried to analyze the behavior against the rain rate. Taking this into consideration, we try to observe the relation of brightness temperature difference of least and most affected channels with rain rate. Fig 6 (b) shows the variation of brightness temperature difference (Tb) with rain rate (mm/h), which is exponential in nature. We follow the same procedure on land also, and the exponential relation holds well over land too,
