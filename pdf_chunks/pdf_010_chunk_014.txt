( Cloudy pixels) Third step : First set of clear pixels. If abs(BTmax – BT11 ) < 2 K, then Cloudflag = 0 (Clear sky pixel) For rest of the points Cloudflag = 9 ( For further test ) For points with Cloudflag = 9 , SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATION Solar zenith angle has to be calculated for determining the day / night condition of the pixel. Solar zenith angle (s) : s (in radian) = /2 – ASIN((SIN SIN(latitude)) + COS COS(latitude) COSH) (1)  (in radian) = solar declination angle = 0.39785SIN(4.869 + 0.0172cday + 0.03345SIN(6.224+0.0172cday)) (2) H = sun hour angle at time ,‘t’ (in IST hrs.), in a calender day (cday) IF (t GT 12) AND (longitude GT 82.5) THEN H = t1 + L (3) Otherwise, IF ((t LT 12) AND (longitude LT 82.5)) THEN H = t1 + L (4) Otherwise, H = t1 – L (5) Where, L = ABS(longitude – 82.5) (6) t1 = 15(ABS(12-t)) (7) If the solar zenith angle > 86.5 º Then pixel is considered to be falling in the night time. else Pixel is in the day time. Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 21 BT11 - BT3.9 TEST (For points with Cloudflag = 9 ) Channel (3.9 μm) measures radiances in the window region near 3.8-4 μm so that the difference between BT11 and BT3.9 can be used to detect the presence of clouds. At night the difference between the brightness temperatures measured in the shortwave (3.9 μm) and in the longwave (11 μm) window regions (BT11 – BT3.9) can be used to detect partial cloud or thin cloud within the INSAT field of view. Small or negative differences are observed only for the case where an opaque scene (such as thick cloud or the surface)
