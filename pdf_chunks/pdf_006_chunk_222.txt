, represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 187 12.4.1.1.2 Height assignment The height assignments of the selected tracers corresponding to each retrieved vectors are derived using the following widely used methods viz. the water vapor histogram method (HIST) and the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993). Once final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: a. Water Vapor Histogram Methods (HIST): In this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. Semitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual movement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in these cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud emissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively.
