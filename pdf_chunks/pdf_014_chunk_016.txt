orbits during the 10- day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the data product. There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps (Kulkarni et al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer composition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this period optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite product for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done using the daily data. 1.4.2.2. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) The NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus clouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance difference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is insensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al. 2006). The NDSI is analogous to the normalized- difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI can be computed as given below; NDSI = (VisibleINSAT B1 - SWIRINSAT B2) / (VisibleINSAT B1 + SWIRINSAT B2) Pixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI values more than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et al. 2006). These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et al, 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are
