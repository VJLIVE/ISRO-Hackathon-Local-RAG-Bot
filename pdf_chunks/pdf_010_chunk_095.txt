the second step, first, the (This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al.

Fig. 2(b) shows the correction of RH as a function of rain. Fig. 2(c) shows the correction rain amount as a function of corrected RH. (This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003)) (b) Warm-top modification The equilibrium level is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops with that of equilibrium level. This level comes before tropopause for the warm rain. In H-E method, Eta model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine equilibrium temperature of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels that are warmer than the equilibrium level temperature.  If the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb10.7 of the pixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows: Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 76 Tb10.7 – [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less)  If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows Tb10.7 – [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) (c) Orography and Parallax correction Orography adjustment is carried out using 850 –hPa Winds and topography from a digital elevation model at 4 km resolution to derive vertical component of wind (Vicente et al., 2002). This vertical wind component is then scaled into a
