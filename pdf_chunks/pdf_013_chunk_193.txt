without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain baring clouds. 3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR – TB’s. 4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness temperatures colder than 240K. 5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / SSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. 6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top brightness temperature (11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds along with Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave Imager-TMI). 7. The global bias correction based on a polynomial model of the suitable form designed on the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). 8. The orographic correction is based on the climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions (Mahesh et al., 2014). 9. Cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Mahesh et al., 2014 and Woodley , Sancho and Vicente (1972) 10. Validation of rainfall with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of algorithm. 11. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid scales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm. 12. Estimation of daily merged rainfall products from both satellite based IMSRA and IMD’s national Rain Gauge data. 15.3. Inputs 15.3.1. Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) The details for the required satellite data for both GPI and IMSRA are provided in following table: INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 168 Parameter Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-1 channel (10.5) -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of TIR-2
