Spatial: pixel size Temporal: 3/6 hourly Provided by IMD In RFP, IMD has proposed its own model instead of Eta model. It is assumed that IMD model works as good (or even better) as Eta model in terms of spatial resolution and accuracies. 4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 4.4.1 Overview: 4.4.1.1 Theoretical Background Physical explanation of rainfall estimation from Visible and IR images The most satellite rainfall monitoring methods seek to: 1. Identify areas of probable precipitation, through recognition of most rain/no-rain boundaries Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 70 2. Evaluate associated rainrate 3. Combine (1) and (2) through time where estimates of total accumulated rainfall are required The objective of present day satellite research is blending of different types of data, from both satellite and non-satellite sources, into the `best possibleâ€™ rainfall product. Rainfall estimation using Visible and IR satellite rainfall algorithm - physical premise 1. In the visible region of the spectrum the basic physical assumption is that cloud brightness is an indicator of cloud thickness, and this inturn is an indicator of rainfall. Unfortunately these relationships are neither simple nor constant; for example, because by no means all bright clouds precipitate. 2. In the thermal IR, the basic physical premise is that cloud top temperature is a function of cloud top height, and that higher and colder cloud tops evidence thicker clouds
