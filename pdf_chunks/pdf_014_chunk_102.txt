solar zenith angle and land fraction (for a given grid) are generated. In data assimilation, satellite and solar zenith angles and land fraction are required along with CSBT. As already stated that CSBT is calculated for clear pixels only, therefore, for averaging operational cloud mask product is also used. INSAT-3D/3DR operational cloud mask product provides a flag which has one of the four values 0,1,2 and 3. 0 indicates clear pixel, 1 indicates cloudy pixel, 3 is representative of probably clear pixel and 3 indicates probably cloudy pixel. While calculating average of aforementioned parameters, the total of pixels (N), clear pixels (N1) and probably clear pixels (N2) within a given grid are also counted. These counts (N, N1 and N2) determine whether CSBT product will be computed for a given grid or not. A dynamic threshold which is 10% of total count value N is taken. If total number of clear and probable clear pixels (N1+N2) is less than the threshold value and CSBT and other products are not generated, but if this is greater than the threshold value then it is checked if N1 is also greater then threshold or not. However, in both the cases CSBT and other parameters are computed but if N1 is less than the threshold then quality flag of CSBT is termed as not very good quality. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 89 In addition to the average of parameters, standard deviation of BT for a given box is also computed. This standard deviation is also provided along with CSBT values to help in deciding the spread of BT value for a given box. More standard deviation may help in flagging out some of the CSBT value as it may have some contamination of cloud (or cloud edges) 7.5.5. Quality indicators As it
