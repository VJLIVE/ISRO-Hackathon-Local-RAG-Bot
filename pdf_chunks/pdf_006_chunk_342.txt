the lower atmosphere condensed in cold conditions. The fog droplets are much smaller than the cloud droplet. The presence of these droplets affects the atmospheric visibility. The radiation difference between the cloud and fog is due to the spectral response differences of every channel. This provides the basis of fog detection. 17.2.2 Objective To identify the presence of fog from INSAT-3D data 17.3 Inputs The following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration 17.3.1 Static Data Data Resolution Unit Source Surface elevation above mean sea level Pixel level meters USGS or other gridded data available on internet.
