direction of WV channels 6. GeoX2 Dimension for VIS and SWIR channels 7. GeoY2 Dimension for VIS and SWIR channels GeoY* and GeoX* contains the scan and pixel values of the image along scan and pixel direction. For L1C Products, following dimensions are created: Table 2.28 Dimension for L1C Products S. No. Dimension Name Description 1. time Time dimension for All Channels 1. X Dimension for pixel direction of all channels 2. Y Dimension for scan direction of all channels 3. proj_dim Dimension for Grid Mapping Dataset The X dimension contains the projection coordinates along pixel direction starting from left. And Y dimension contains projection coordinates along scan direction starting from top. X and Y dimensions have following attributes required as part of CF conventions: Table 2.29 Attributes of X,Y dimensions for L1C Products S.No. Dimension Name Attribute Name Value 1. X long_name x coordinate of projection 2. X standard_name projection_x_coordinate 3. X units m 4. Y long_name y coordinate of projection 5. Y standard_name projection_y_coordinate 6. Y units m For L1B and L1C Products, following dimension is also created: Table 2.30 Additional Dimension for L1B and L1C Products S. No. Dimension Name Description 1. GreyCount Dimension for storing calibration information as lookup table for all the channels. 21 Time dimension has following Attributes: Table 2.31 Attributes of Time Dimension S. No. Attribute Name Units Description 1. units “minutes since 2000-01-01 00:00:00” Units of Time dimension NOTES: 1. All the dimension scales have an attribute named REFERENCE_LIST which is maintained by HDF5 dimension scale API for referring to in which all datasets it is being used as dimension. 2. All the Datasets in Products have and attribute named DIMENSION_LIST whose value is an array of references to the dimension scales (e.g. time, GeoY, GeoX). This attribute is maintained by the
