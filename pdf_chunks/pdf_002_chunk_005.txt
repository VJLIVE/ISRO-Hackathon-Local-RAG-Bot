onboard MT. The frequencies above 90 GHz are commonly used for studying the cloud properties (e.g., Liu and Curry, 1990, Weng, 2003, etc.). Hong et al. (2005) have studied the sensitivity of the microwave brightness temperatures to hydrometeors at 89- 190 GHz frequencies, and found that frequencies near water vapor absorption band at 183.31 GHz (e.g., AMSU-B channels) are nearly independent of surface emissivity because of atmospheric opacity at these frequencies. This finding allows development of retrieval algorithms for rain/cloud and other atmospheric parameters independent of the underlying surface type. Several other researchers (e.g., Muller et al., 1994; Hong et al., 2005) have also studied the effect of cloud ice and precipitation on AMSU-B water vapor channels. A depression in the satellite measured brightness temperature at frequencies near water vapor absorption line (183.31 GHz) is resulted from the hydrometeors on the top of the cloud, and the depression increases for frequencies away from the water vapor absorption line (Burns et al., 1997). Thus for SAPHIR, we expect higher depression for 183.3111 GHz channel. Bennartz and Bauer (2003) have studied the sensitivity of the frequencies near 183.31 GHz water vapor absorption line to ice particle scattering in different environmental conditions, and reported little sensitivity to precipitating clouds below 8 km of altitude, which they attributed to the peaking of the weighting functions at higher altitudes. The study by Bennartz and Bauer (2003) was conducted for middle and higher latitude conditions and for 1837, 1833, 1831 GHz channels, we, however, expect a higher sensitivity of SAPHIR 18311 GHz channel to precipitating clouds. SAPHIR on MT collects microwave radiances from the environment at 6 channels around water vapor absorption band at 183.3 GHz. These channels are referred as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 with central operating frequency of 183.31±0.2 GHz, 183.31±1.1
