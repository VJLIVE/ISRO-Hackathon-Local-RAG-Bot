from INSAT sounder retrievals 6.3 Inputs 6.3.2 Dynamic Data Geopotential heights of standard pressure levels, temperature and humidity retrieved from the sounder. 6.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 6.4.1 Overview 6.4.1.1 Theoretical Background See section 6.2.1 6.4.2 Operational Implementation 1) From the retrieved temperature profile at standard pressure level, the pressure level at which temperature reaches 0o C is estimated by means of interpolation. Height of the Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 379 melting layer is then estimated by using the standard formula based on hydrostatic approximation. 2) Mixing ratio at melting level is also obtained by means of interpolation of retrieved humidity. 3) Mean mixing ratio in the lowest one km is also estimated by using retrieved specific humidity profile at standard pressure levels. 4) Lapse rate between surface and melting layer is easily estimated by dividing surface temperature by height of the mixing layer (in km). These parameters are substituted in the formula for WI given in section 6.2.1. 6.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution WI knots 0 - - 0.5x 0.5 deg 6.5.1 Format of the output and the domain Lat, lon, WI Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E. 6.6 Validation 6.6.1 Data required Collocated radiosonde measurements during convective events, measurement of wind gust at surface. 6.6.2 Methods of validation Direct Comparison 6.7 Technical issues (Limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles. This index may be region dependent. 6.8 References Pryor, K.L., Ellrod, G.P., and A.A., Bailey, 2002: Convective downburst potential using GOES sounder derived products.
