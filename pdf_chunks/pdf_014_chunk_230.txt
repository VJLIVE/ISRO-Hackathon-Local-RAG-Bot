As the Earth’s surface is not transparent, so we can safely assume mir mir    1 and solve the above equations to retrieve MIR reflectance. ) 5 ( ) ( ) ( 0 0 '       T B F T B L mir mir mir mir mir mir mir       The transmission functions depend on the temperature and water vapor in the atmospheric column. In the present version of the algorithm, we would assume the emissivities and transmittivities to equal to 1.0. This assumption should cause errors within acceptable limits i.e., ≤ 0.02 in reflectance units in the retrieved MIR reflectance. We would try and incorporate the more appropriate values of emissivities and transmittivities in the subsequent version of the algorithms. 16.4.2. Operational retrieval Implementation The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows:
