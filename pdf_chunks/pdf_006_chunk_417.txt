Here, is relative optical airmass. The are fitted parameters for every extinction process. The values are taken from Paulescu and Schlett (2003) as given in Table 4.

Summary of fitted parameters for different atmospheric components influencing radiative transfer through atmosphere (Paulescu and Schlett 2003) Atmospheric variables Ozone ( ) 0.0184 0.0004 0.022 -0.66 Water vapour ( ) 0.002 1.67*10-5 0.094 -0.693 Other gases ( ) -5.4*10-5 -3.8*10-6 0.0099 -0.62 Aerosol ( ) 1.053 -0.083 0.3345 -0.668 20.4.1.2 Diffuse irradiance . The instantaneous diffuse irradiance is contributed from three components (i) molecular (Rayleigh) scattering (ii) aerosol scattering and (iii) multiple scattering of ground reflected radiation from atmosphere.

(2010) based on differences in brightness temperatures in thermal IR and WV channels of Kalpana-1 VHRR.
