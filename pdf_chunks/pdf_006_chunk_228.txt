are done either through Quality Indicator (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and quality control procedure is proposed and implemented first time in AMV retrieval. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 3). The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 190 number j i j i c j i v i u V , , ,   . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image- pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height).

Here X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors.
