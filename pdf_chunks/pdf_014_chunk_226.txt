Introduction This document describes the land surface reflectance retrieval algorithm for the MIR spectral band (3.8-4.0 µm) of Imager sensor of INSAT-3DR. MIR reflectance consists of both reflective and emissive parts. Previous studies have shown that, full radiance (reflective and emissive) can not be used for the studies involving global studies, where temperature gradients are due to the latitudinal/topographical variations. We remove the emissive component using the brightness temperature computed from the 11 µm channel and making simple assumptions about the emissivities and transmittivities in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 µm. These assumptions are found to be conservative in the expected range of temperatures(T > 290 K). More appropriate values of emissivities and transmittivities would be adopted in the subsequent version of the algorithm, which would evolve with time and experimentation. This algorithm is analyzed through the comparison with the collocated and synchronous MODIS/METEOSAT surface reflectance products. 16.2.1. Overview and background Mid-IR channel on Imager can be utilized for the detection of dark dense vegetation, burned areas etc., which can be used for land use/cover dynamics related studies. Red and NIR channels are traditionally used for detecting burned areas. However, these channels are highly affected by the aerosol scattering and absorption caused by the biomass burning (Kaufman and
