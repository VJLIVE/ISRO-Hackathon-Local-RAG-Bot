 Let the source image s and target image t is registered to same scale. For every given m x m (typically 32 x 32 pixels) sub-image cs of the tracer in image s, an n x n (n > m) search window wt is selected in t. The center co-ordinates of cs and wt are identical as s and t are registered to the same scale.  Given cs and wt, the problem of detection of WVWV is to find out best correlation measure between cs and any one of m x m sub-image within wt. The vector originating from the center co-ordinate of cs to the center of best-matched m x m sub-image of wt gives the WVWV.  The correlation measures are some sort of similarity measure between time varying sub-images. This similarity measures can be accomplished either by maximum cross-correlation or sum of the squared difference measure or by Nash- Sutcliffe model efficiency function (Deb et al. 2008). Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 186 Figure 1: The schematic for WVWV detection process The description of each step is given in the following: 12.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection: At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value
