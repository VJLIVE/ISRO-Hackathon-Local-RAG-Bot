example, CO2 slicing algorithm was replaced by H2O intercept algorithm for assigning the height to semitransparent tracers. Other improvements were (i) automated correction of navigation inconsistencies within the imageries (ii) inclusion of spatial filters in tracer selection methodology to filter undesirable scenes. 11.2.2 Objective The main objective of this study is to derive the Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) over land and sea using multiple half hourly IR images. The region over which the winds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point. 11.3 Inputs 11.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Source Continental boundary data 4 km DP (IMD data) 11.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of split window IR channel (10.5-11.5 m and 11.5-12.5 m) and WV channel (6.7 m) (All the data is required in fixed lat-lon grid for continuous 8-images separated by 30 minutes time interval) pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data by DP (data processing) Gray value to brightness temperature conversion table - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Geo-location file Pixel - 4 km Derived by DP 11.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Numerical model forecast of wind for all levels 1 degree 2 m/s (speed) 20o (direction) IMD All levels model forecast Temperature 1o K Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 167 11.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 11.4.1 Overview 11.4.1.1 Methodology 11.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection At the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence analysis
