The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm are able to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to suffer from huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and its validation in smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). The results presented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison results of the global standard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a recent study by Tan et al. (2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution precipitation products including TRMM-3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that among 5 satellite based rain products, the 3B42 V7 and is the best performing with respect to surface observations, which on daily scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much more diverse surface and climatic conditions with different cloud types and wide range of precipitation rates during S-W months, we achieve much higher correlation between modified H-E rain with surface observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E vis-Ã -vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D H-E is available within 15 SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 26 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical weather predictions. Based on above analysis, we can summarize the results as follows: 1. H-E in the present form performs
