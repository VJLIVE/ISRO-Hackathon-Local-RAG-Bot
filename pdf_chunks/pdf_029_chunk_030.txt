that can be related to the anthropogenic contribution to the total aerosol optical depth. The provisional validation suggests that the operational beta version retrieval is capable of deriving AOD over land within expected uncertainty. However, it is necessary to perform extensive validation exercises including more ground truth sites with more OCM-2 data. As already discussed in the introductory section the primary objective of developing this algorithm is intended to cater inputs for radiative and air-quality studies over the Indian landmass. However, with this aerosol product, OCM-2 data utilization can be extended to other land applications also, which was to date limited to ocean Colour applications only. Just as part of this discussion and to appreciate the utility of OCM aerosol product for other land applications, we have shown OCM-2 NDVI product derived with and without aerosol correction in figure 9. The drastic improvement apparent in NDVI establishes the possible utility of this AOD product in many other land applications in addition to radiative and air-quality related studies. Figure 10. Drastic improvement in OCM-2 derived NDVI after correction for aerosol is apparent in the images shown. 28 10.0 References Charslon, R.J., Langer, J., Rodhe, H., Levoy, C.B. and Warren, S.G., 1991, Perturbation of the northern hemisphere radiative balance by backscattering from anthropogenic sulfate aerosols.
