coarser sized particles in central India. (d) AERONET size distribution at Bhola station showing the dominance of fine mode aerosol. 2 March 2016 AOD plume due to forest fire 25 Figure 9. Validation results of the OCM-2 AOD using AERONET in-situ AOD at different stations. 7.0 Technical issues (Limitations etc.)  The aerosol retrieval may fail at very bright surfaces due to physical limitations or due to the saturation of data. For very bright surfaces after a certain value of aerosol optical depth, the model radiance becomes highly inaccurate.  In the current version of the algorithm, the fine mode fraction values are used at discrete levels therefore fine mode maps may show pixelated appearance.  Validation of the fine mode fraction is difficult as no in-situ observations are available, however, in the future fine mode AOD (FAOD) may be correlated with AERONET inverted FAOD values.  Using OCM-2 channels it is not possible to identify snowy pixels, therefore though snow pixels are expected to be masked as cloudy pixels due to high reflectance but still partially snow contaminated or less reflecting snow pixels may so unexpected AOD retrieved values. In 26 future versions, AWIFS based snow climatology can be used for the identification of snowy pixels.  For AOD retrievals the OCM-2 radiance image is down-sampled by the average filter of 3 x 3- pixel size to improve the signal-to-noise ratio required for AOD retrieval. If retrieval is performed at the original resolution the uncertainty may reach above the targeted uncertainty of <20%.  It is to be noted the aerosol retrieval is very sensitive to the radiance calibration as well as to surface reflectance. An error of 1% sensor measured reflectance or in surface reflectance may lead to an uncertainty of 10% in AOD retrievals. 8.0 Future scope
