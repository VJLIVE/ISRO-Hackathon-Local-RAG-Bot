as it currently exists, and is being delivered for inclusion in the INSAT-3D/3DR processing scheme. Current research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the processes at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear incomplete in places as research continues to improve our understanding of the processes at work. Subsequent revisions of the document will reflect new knowledge and, it is hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here. 2.2 Objective Development of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi-channel Imager data from INSAT-3D/3DR. 2.3 Inputs 2.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Land /Sea Mask Pixel ( ~4 km) 1 pixel USGS(available) Climatological SST data 0.25 X 0.25 degree 0.5 K Reynolds SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 5 2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Res.

Algorithm Functional Specifications 3.1 Overview 3.1.1 Theoretical Background Radiance from Earth’s terrestrial emission peaks at around 10 m and it has minimum attenuation by atmospheric gases. Hence in order to measure earth’s surface temperature, space borne sensors are
