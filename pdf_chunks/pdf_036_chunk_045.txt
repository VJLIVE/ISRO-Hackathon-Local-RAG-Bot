The SARAL/AltiKa Project Phases The satellite mission has two main phases (verification and operational). SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 31 Figure 12 : SARAL Mission Phases and associated responsibilities 2.6.4.1. The verification phase The verification phase (9 -10 months since beginning of cycle 1) began shortly after launch, when the satellite reached the operational (nominal repetitive) orbit and the satellite and sensor systems were functioning normally. This phase continued until the data received from the sensors were satisfactorily calibrated and verified. During this calibration/validation phase, the quality control will be achieved through many steps as a series of quality controls designed to ensure a continuous supply of data : regular cyclic data product analysis (complete parameter analysis and diagnostics, missions/edited measurements, crossovers and along-track analysis, orbit analysis, …), cross-calibration with other altimeters (SARAL/AltiKa,…), instrumental expertise for altimeter and radiometer monitoring, and by performing absolute calibration at dedicated in situ calibration sites. This verification phase is divided in 2 phases which overlap: 1. One dedicated to the validation of the near real time products (OGDRs). 2. The second phase dedicated to the validation
