At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts of the report. i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. ii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor motion vectors through the last 12 months. iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. The vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde report used for verification is given by (VD) = [ (Ui – Ur)2 + (Vi – Vr)2 ]1/2 The speed bias is given by The mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is And the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is N (SD) = [1/N ∑ ( (Vdi) – (MVD) )2 ]1/2 I=1 The root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, (RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2 It must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. N (BIAS)i = 1/N ∑ [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ] i=1 N
