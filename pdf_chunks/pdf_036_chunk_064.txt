solution. The altimeter data reprocessing consists in a new atmospherical forcing response correction (Mog2D-G) applied to the data before the harmonic analysis. FES2004 includes the M2, S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, P1, Q1 tides. Four hydrodynamical long period tides and the non-linear M4 tide are also included in the distribution package. A new prediction algorithm is associated with FES2004. This algorithm use an admittance method to extends the prediction spectrum up to 36 tidal constituents. The FES2004 model also provides non-equilibrium models for the Mm, Mf, Mtm, and Msqm tidal components, which are provided by parameter ocean_tide_non_equil.

Sea Surface Height Bias Recommendation The estimate of the absolute bias in the SARAL/AltiKa sea-surface height measurements (SSH) is one of the goals of the Cal/Val phase and is therefore not fully consolidated at this time. The Sea State Bias (SSB) can be defined as the difference between the apparent sea level as “seen” by the altimeter and the actual mean sea level. It is composed of : the Electromagnetic bias (EMB), and skewness and tracker biases that affect the accuracy of altimeter measurements and are all dependent on SWH. The EMB (main contributor) results from the fact that the radar senses an average sea surface lower than the true average sea surface, due to amplification from wave troughs. This bias can be expressed as a percentage of SWH, with the percentage being a complex function of the sea-surface slope and elevation statistical distribution. As a first guess, we assume that the SSB value is 3.5% of SWH. A consolidated SSB solution will be computed about one year after launch, to interpolate the SSB value bilinearly from a table (empirical model derived from analyses of the altimeter data) as a function of SWH and wind speed. It should be
