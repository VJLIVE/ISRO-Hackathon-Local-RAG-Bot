be always true.  All aerosols were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Perturbations by aerosols below cloud were not considered.  Ground brightness and cloud top albedo are represented by minimum VIS TOA albedo of previous 30 days. Instead, minimum shortwave albedo needs to be used.  Apart from the above, the sources of uncertainties enumerated in the validation section (section 1.6.3.1) are the sources of inaccuracies. Surface insolation over land INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 359 20.9 Future scope of improvement  Megha-Trophique (MT) ScaRaB data can be utilized to know the relation between VIS spectral albedo and shortwave albedo radiance, fluxes which will help in computing shortwave albedo including surface and cloud-top. The relation can be extended to INSAT VIS band data to know the minimum ground brightness.  Revised cloud transmission should be introduced separately for different cloud types of low, medium and high level for different background land types.  The near-real time diurnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm from INSAT 3D ‘Imager’ would help minimize the uncertainities introduced by aerosol climatology. The network of diurnal measurements of aerosol optical depth and its other properties from 10 IMD land stations or AERONET over India can be explored to offset bias in AOD estimates. The real-time availability of these data would help remove the residual bias.  Bias correction model would be developed from validation results from one year datasets and will be applied later to improve the accuracy.  Quality flag should be tagged with insolation product. 20.10 References 1.
