INTRODUCTION Weather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many aspects of the world's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important components of Weather and climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange of water substance between sea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and evaporation processes significantly affect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative assessment of precipitation is needed to improve understanding of the behavior of global energy and circulation patterns as well as the nature of climate variability. The choice of measured
