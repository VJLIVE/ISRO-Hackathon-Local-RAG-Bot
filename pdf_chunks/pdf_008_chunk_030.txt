This is mainly due to spatially averaged measurement of rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 12 also shows the performance of modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be noted here that neither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset has provides measurements over oceans. So the comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing the quality of H-E rain over oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from H-E and 3B42 RT has a good agreement over oceans with correlation of 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 mm/day. If all area including land and oceans including and surrounding India are taken into consideration, the correlation and rmse between H-E and TRMM-3B42 V7 is 0.59
