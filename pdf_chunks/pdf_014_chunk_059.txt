The block diagram to compute LE from iterative solution is shown below. In the flow chart (Figure 1), TSD is the surface dew point temperature (0C), M is moisture availability at surface (0-1) TD is dew point temperature (0C). The input needed for computation of ŒªE mentioned in equation (2) are air temperature (Ta), LST (Ts), Relative humidity (RH), Net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G), For clear sky conditions, hourly Net radiation (Rn) product will be used as input. Air temperature and relative humidity will be taken from WRF model at 2m height on hourly scale. LST obtained from INSAT 3DR will be used on-hourly scale as input to this model. In order to solve net surface available energy, …∏ (=Rn ‚ÄìG) as mentioned in equation (2) and (6) we need to obtain soil heat flux. The soil heat flux can be obtained by two approaches: INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 52 Figure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the core equations used to recover the internal state variables in STIC (Mallick et.al. 2014) 4.4.2. Soil heat flux model Statitsical approach The ratio of daytime soil heat flux and net radiation from AMS measurements over short vegetative systems were found to produce logarithmic relation with INSAT 3A CCD NDVI at 1 km. This relation was used to derive the soil heat flux (Bhattacharya
