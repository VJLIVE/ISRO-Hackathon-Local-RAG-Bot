Local area coverage mode of Ocean Colour Monitor on-board OceanSat-2.. 4.3 Theoretical background AOD 𝜏 is the measure of aerosols distributed within the column of air from the ground instrument to the top of the atmosphere or from the space-borne sensor to the surface. AOD is the degree to which aerosol prevents the transmission of the light by absorption or scattering of light and is defined as the integrated extinction coefficient of light due to aerosol over a vertical atmospheric column of unit cross-section (mathematically represented by equation 1). Extinction coefficient 𝐾𝑒𝑥𝑡 is defined as the fractional depletion of radiance per unit length. 𝜏= ∫𝐾𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑧)𝑑𝑧 𝑙 0 (1) The following description is intended to provide the basic structure of the algorithm that can derive aerosol optical depth and fine mode fraction from OceanSat-2 OCM data, which acquires top of the atmosphere radiance in 8 narrow spectral channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, 490, 510, 550, 620, 740 and 865 nm with high radiometric accuracy. The overall workflow for the proposed algorithm/technique for aerosol retrieval using OCM-2 data is shown in section 4.4. It mainly involves four components: (a) Masking of the pixel for which retrieval is
