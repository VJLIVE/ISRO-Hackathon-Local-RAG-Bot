of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 171 compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking method in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean region (Deb et al., 2008).

In most of the operational centers the AMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in
