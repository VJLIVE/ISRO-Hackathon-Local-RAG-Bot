d) Wind speed (ms-1) at 10 m height MOSDAC 19.4 Algorithm functional specifications In 1948, Penman combined the energy balance with the mass transfer and derived an equation to compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard meteorological records of sunshine, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This combination method was further extended to vegetated surface by introducing resistance term. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have been added to the original equation of Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) from a surface. This formulation is referred as FAO-56 Penman and Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) ETo for a day. This is treated as standardized model worldwide. This is described as follows:       2 2 34 .0 1 273 900 408 .0 u e e u T G R ET a s n o            (1) o ET = = reference evapotranspiration for a day (mm day-1) n R = net radiation at the crop surface (MJm-2day-1) G = Soil heat flux (MJm-2day-1) Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 315 T = mean daily air temperature at 2 meter height (oC) 2 u = wind speed at 2 meter height (ms-1) se = satuation vapour pressure (kPa) ae = actual vapour pressure (kPa) a s e e  = saturation vapour pressure deficit (kPa)  = slope of vapour pressure curve (kPa oC-1)  = Psychrometric constant (kPa oC-1) hr T = mean hourly air temperature (oC) The above FAO Penman and Monteith equation is a close representation of the physical and physiological factors governing the evapotranspiration process. To compute ETo from FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approach following intermediate inputs are calculated as follows: 19.4.1 Saturation vapour pressure (es) As saturation vapour pressure (SVP) is related
