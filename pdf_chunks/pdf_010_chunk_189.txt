campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later on. Post-Launch Satellite-Based Inter-comparisons INSAT-3D Imager derived aerosol optical depths may be validated by comparing them with aerosol optical depths derived by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS. The basic inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where both sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter- comparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements. 10.7 Technical issues (Limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the satellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. i) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study. Use of darkest observation for last 20 days provides mean reflectivity. 10.8 Future Scope i) In future algorithms making use of INSAT-3D imager data for SWIR and MIR bands can also be attempted for characterization of surface reflectivity. 10.9 References 1.
