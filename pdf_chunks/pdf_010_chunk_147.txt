on all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the data product. There has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer composition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this period optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. The repeat period of the satellite is 16 days. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite product for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done using the daily data. 7.4.1.1.2 Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) The NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus clouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance difference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is insensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions, is partially normalized for atmospheric effects, and does not depend on reflectance in a single band (Kulkarni 2006). The NDSI is analogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI = (INSAT Band 1 - INSAT Band 2) / (INSAT Band 1 + INSAT Band 2) Pixels that are approximately 25 % or greater covered by snow have been found to have NDSI values 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et. al., 2006). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to
