In regions such as the western Great Plains of the United States (e.g. near Denver), the environmental air is often so dry that evaporative cooling causes dangerous downdraft called downbursts. Hazardous downbursts can occur even under cloud bases where precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground. The smaller-diameter but intense downbursts are called microbursts. Downbursts of 0.5 to 5 km in diameter have been observed. For extreme cases, downdraft speeds of nearly 10 m/s have been observed 100 m above ground. This is particularly hazardous to landing and departing aircraft, because this vertical velocity can sometimes exceed aircraft climb rate. Doppler radars can detect some of the downbursts and give early warning to pilots (Roland Stull, 2000). In India dry desert regions, elevated plains, mountain regions where air is very dry may be susceptible to microburst. Generally dry microburst occurs in situations characterized by high convective cloud bases and strong evaporational cooling in the
