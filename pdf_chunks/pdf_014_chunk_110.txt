Tb18. The difference must be less than 10K. If any of these SAF test is fail then the whole FOR is assigned as cloudy. Otherwise clear flag is assigned to whole FOR. SAF is followed by final and Individual FOV Flag (IFF). In IFF series of tests are applied to individual FOV of a given box. (d). Individual FOV Flag (IFF): Snow test: This test is daytime test and discriminates between snow and cloud. If visible reflectance of FOV is greater than the minimum reflectance (already defined in PAF) and skin temperature is greater than a threshold (275K) then FOV is cloudy otherwise clear. Threshold in this case can be adjusted to any value in the range of 273 to 285 K. Secondary stratus test: In this test difference of moisture corrected Tb7 and Tb8 is compared with a threshold. The threshold depends on Tb7 and difference of skin temperature (Ts) and surface air temperature (Ta), both from forecast. Th2 = max[ NET(Ch7), 0.25*(Ta-Ts)], here Ts is calculated using 2 or 3 channels depending on daytime and nighttime situation. TPW=max(Tb8) – max(Tb7), in 3x3 pixel FOR Tb7(corrected) = Tb7 + TPW Cirrus test: If the Tb5 of FOV under consideration is less than the value of noise corrected Tb5 value corresponding to FOV having maximum Tb8 in the given FOR, then the test is said to be failed. Tb5(Noise corrected) = {Tb5 corresponding to max(Tb8)} - 7.0*NET(Ch#5) Final skin temperature test: [Tb8 + {Tb8 – Tb7}@max(Tb7)] < Ts, then test is assumed to be fail. If one FOV passes all the tests then that FOV is upgraded to clear. If FOV fails any of the tests then it is flagged as cloudy or partially cloudy depending on the SAF flag.
