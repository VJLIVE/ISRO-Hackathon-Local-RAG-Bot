INTRODUCTION: Satellite measurements of ocean colour allow synoptic coverage of ocean biological production on a global scale. Satellite derived chlorophyll measurements provide global distribution of phytoplankton CHL- a on high spatial and temporal scale. The accurate measurements of ocean chlorophyll concentration are very critical to understand the regional and global impact of climate change on marine ecosystem. Considering the contribution of chlorophyll-a measurements to the characterization of Earth’s climate, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has identified CHL-a as one of the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) under ocean category. However, the continuous availability of satellite based CHL-a is a major challenge due to the obstruction of the visible part of the e.m spectrum by clouds. Moreover, the observations from ocean colour near coastal region suffer from inaccurate atmospheric correction due to the optical complexity in the coastal waters. Coupled physical-biogeochemical modelling provides a key insight into the interaction of elements in the physical and biogeochemical system of marine ecosystem. The coupled models, thus become an essential tool in the scientific community to elucidate the mechanism of physical and marine system and predict its evolution in both space and time scale. It enhanced the scope to study the biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing, which is a key component in the climate change science and environmental
