Abstract: The Hydro-Estimator (H-E) is a INSAT-3D based high resolution rain estimation method which combines NCEP model parameters with satellite observations. The Hydro- Estimator developed at SAC is based on similar operational method at NOAA/STAR. The H-E is operationally implemented. This report addresses the validation of H-E in the present form. It is found that the H-E in its present form works well over most parts of the country but has weakness over hilly terrains. The problem is identified and a modified H-E is proposed. The modified H-E shows a good representation of rain over hill terrains. Overall, it gives a correlation of 0.78 and rms difference of 46.64 mm when compared with weakly meteorological subdivision surface measurements. Its comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 also provides the same correlation and rms difference. It is also found that comparison statistics of weekly met subdivision averaged surface observations with H-E is nearly same as that with 3B42 V7. However, the week-by-week comparison of surface measurements with H-E is more stable than with 3B42 V7. In daily 0.25ox0.25o grid, the correlation and rms difference over land between surface observations and H-E is 0.47 and 25.40 mm/day. A slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and lowered rms difference of 22.40 is observed between H-E and
