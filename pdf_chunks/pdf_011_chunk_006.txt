𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎3(𝑇1 −𝑇2). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) (3) where, SST is the satellite derived SST estimate, T1 and T2 are the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3DR thermal channels (TIR-1 and TIR-2). a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are the retrieval coefficients estimated from the regression analysis using collocated simulated brightness temperatures and SST. The above equation (3) is currently operational at MOSDAC and IMD, Delhi. The validation results of operational SST with in-situ and MODIS SST products has been presented in science team meeting of Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) held at China during 05-09 June, 2017. In the meeting the Science Team members suggested to drop the square term of the difference between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 & TIR-2, being used for correcting the atmospheric water vapour contamination. It was point out that if there is large noise in thermal channels, the square of their difference may result in large errors in SST, which was also observed on many occasions in the operational products. Therefore, based on the recommendations from GHRSST Science Team and subsequent validation analysis of the operational SST products, the SST retrieval algorithm has been modified to address this issue of large errors in SST due to non-linear WV correction term. The revised algorithm follows Walton et al. (1998) for SST retrieval which has the following form: Day-time: 𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(secθ −1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) (4) Night-time: 𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇3 + 𝑎2(secθ −1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) (5) where, T3 is the brightness temperature of MIR channel. Tsfc is the a priori estimate of SST that can be taken from the climatology or from the forecast of the numerical weather prediction models. All
