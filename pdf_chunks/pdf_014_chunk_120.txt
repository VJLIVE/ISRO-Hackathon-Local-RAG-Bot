thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level can be computed using the formula ) ln( P P g T R Z s v d  Ps – Surface Pressure, P – Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, vT - Layer mean virtual temperature. This can be computed at all the retrieved pressure levels. Virtual temperature Tv is given by T q Tv ) 61 .0 1(   where q is specific humidity expressed in Kg/Kg, T is temperature in K. 9.5.5. Effective cloud amount Effective cloud amount N* for a given FOR is computed by using the eq (3) X∗= X,YZ[\++/X5^5 Where X∗ is the effective cloud amount for a given FOR, X,YZ is the total number of cloudy pixels within a given FOR, X5^5 is the total number of pixels in a FOR and [\++ is the effective cloud amount retrieved. For window channel method [\++ = ) 9.5.6. Radiance bias adjustment It is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily dependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and the fast forward RT model. If forward simulations are not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in the retrieved products. To make observations and forward model simulations consistent, a radiance bias adjustment is necessary step. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 106 Radiance bias adjustment is carried out by using previous eight days of good quality matchup data of INSAT-3D/3DR Imager clear-sky observations and spatially and temporally collocated simulated INSAT-3D/3DR Imager radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS analysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky observations are average over 9x9 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% pixels
