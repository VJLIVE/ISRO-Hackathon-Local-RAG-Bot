discussed earlier. These results appear to be more encouraging in view of similar comparison that we carried out between TMI and PR for a period of 10 days from 21-30 May 2009 that shows a correlation of 0.61, rms error of 2.23 mm/h, and bias of 0.1 mm/h for total number of observations of 1.88 million. It may be noted that PR and TMI are on the same orbiting platform with less than a minute of time difference between their observations, whereas we allowed 10 minutes of time difference between SAPHIR and PR observations. Further, we have compared the monthly averaged rain rates from SAPHIR, TRMM- 3B42 and SSMIS. Figure 7 (a), (b) and (c) shows the monthly gridded (0.25oX0.25o) maps of precipitation for the month of May 2013 from SAPHIR, TRMM-3B42 and SSMIS. Here we use SSMIS rain product (Hilburn and Wentz, 2008) which provides rain only over the oceans. As it can be seen there is a good qualitative comparison among three different rain products. The scatter plots of cross comparison among these three monthly maps is plotted in Fig. 8, which shows comparison between SAPHIR versus TRMM-3B42, SAPHIR versus SSMIS and SSMIS versus TRMM-3B42, respectively. The Fig. 8 (a) (b) and (c) shows the comparison over the land as well as the oceans, whereas other two Figs. 7 (d) and (e) shows a comparison over oceans only. The comparison between SAPHIR and TRMM-3B42 is most encouraging with a correlation coefficient of ~0.87 over ocean and 0.82 over land, when ocean and land both considered together correlation becomes 0.84 with rmse of 0.09 mm for 327743 valid points. On the other hand, the comparison of SSMIS monthly rain with monthly rain from SAPHIR and TRMM-3B42 shows a correlation of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. Similar comparison of daily averaged
