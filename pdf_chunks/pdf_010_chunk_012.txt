regions for cloud detection minimizes the I↓/I↑ term and maximizes the B(Tc)/I↑ term. Figure 3 is a simulation of differences in brightness temperature between clear and cloudy sky conditions using the simplified set of equations . In these simulations, there is no atmosphere, the surface is emitting at a blackbody temperature of 290 K, the cloud particles are ice spheres with a gamma size distribution assuming an effective radius of 10 μm, and the cloud optical depth δ = 0.1. Two cloud temperatures are simulated (210 K and 250 K). Brightness temperature differences between the clear and cloudy sky are caused by non-linearity of the Planck function and spectral variation in the single scattering properties of the cloud. This figure does not include the absorption and emission of atmospheric gases, which would also contribute to brightness temperature differences. Observations of brightness temperature differences at two or more wavelengths can help separate the atmospheric signal from the cloud effect. Figure 3: A simple simulation of the brightness temperature differences between a “clear” and cloudy sky as a function of wavelength. The underlying temperature is 290 K and the cloud optical depth is 0.1. All computations assume ice spheres with re = 10 µm. 2.4.1.3 Methodology The basis of our methodology is, first to generate a clear composite of the maximum brightness temperature in thermal channels to get rough idea about the surface temperature in the clear sky condition at a particular time. Here assumption is that any pixel in the image will not be covered by cloud continuously at a particular time for several (user defined no.) days and the maximum brightness temperature will represent the clear sky background temperature of that location. This will be the reference background temperature on which the threshold for a particular location will be determined
