(5). A comparison of derived A0 from the data set and from the Quikscat GMF QSCAT-1 is also depicted. The observed difference between GMF and data derived A0 coefficient is quite evident due to incompleteness of the observation set. Figure 5: Comparison of A0 coefficients derived from Quikscat data and the QSCAT-1 GMF. 10 Due to the non-availability of large data sets of radar backscatter, the above exercise with radar backscatter simulated using NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs has been performed for wind speed only up to 20 m/s which is the specified range for NSCAT-1. The comparison of harmonic coefficients (proxy GMF) established using these two GMFs has been performed (Tiwari and Gohil, 2005) as shown in figure (6). The difference in two GMFs in terms of harmonic coefficients is quite evident. Moreover, the NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs were developed considering two and three harmonics, respectively. The comparison reveals the fact that the GMFs are sensor specific.

In order to develop GMF for rain free conditions, near concurrent observations of rain is also required from other satellites like TRMM-PR/TMI and DMSP-SSM-I. The collection of these data sets is planned for about
