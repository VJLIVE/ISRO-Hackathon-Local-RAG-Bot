area of a storm. His technique involved the skill of a trained meteorologist to find out active portion of a storm. He also utilized the total atmospheric precipitable water (TPW) and water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for dry/wet environment and equilibrium level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm clouds. This method was found to be successful for measuring precipitation but was highly subjective and needed continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the precipitation amount. Thus, it was found difficult to implement it with ease. Successively, an alternate method called Auto-Estimator (A-E) was developed. The aim of the A-E was to SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 4 provide an automated method without human intervention and that could automate the subjective nature of the IFFA, but A-E failed on many occasions because many features of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-Estimator is most recent of the attempts by NOAA/NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated (Scofield and Kuligowaski, 2003). The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not present in IFFA or were defined differently. A brief summary of the Hydro-Estimator is provided in section 2 below. Further details of Hydro-Estimator technique can be found in Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (Varma and Gairola, 2013). 2.0 Hydro-Estimator The H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A- E method, the relationship between 10.7 ÔÅ≠m brightness temperature (Tb) and rain rate (mm h-1) (R) is defined as: R = a exp(-bTb 1.2), -----(1) where, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 (Vicente et al. 1998). The A-E method provides same relationship for core and non-core precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value for core rain and is hereafter referred as (Rc). In H-E, the rain is determined
