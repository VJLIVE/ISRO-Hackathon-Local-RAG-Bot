Introduction India successfully launched its advanced meteorological satellite INSAT-3DR on 26th September 2016 in the geostationary orbit at 74E. The inheritance of this satellite has come from INSAT-3D satellite. Meteorological payloads onboard INSAT-3DR are a 6 channel Imager and a 19 channel Sounder mainly for atmospheric profiles, cyclone and monsoon monitoring, cloud motion vectors winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation monitoring, snow cover detection, mesoscale studies etc. Apart from a 19 channel Sounder in INSAT-3D/3DR, the Imager has a split- window (TIR1/2), mid-IR (MIR) window, and shortwave IR (SWIR) channels in additions to earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana VHRR. Details of the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels are given in Table-1. The spectral response functions (SRF) of TIR1 &2, MIR and WV bands of INSAT-3D are shown in figure (1) along with brightness temperature spectra of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) for a standard tropical atmosphere.
