Algorithm Functional Specifications In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for deriving cloud microphysical parameters using INSAT-3D channels. 11.6.1. Overview The underlying principle on which the retrieval of these microphysical parameters is based is the fact that the reflection function of clouds in the visible band is primarily a function of the cloud optical thickness, whereas the reflection function at a water (or ice) absorbing band in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) is primarily a function of cloud particle size. 11.6.2. Theoretical Background The visible (0.7Âµm) channel is a non-absorbing channel; the reflectance depends only upon the cloud optical depth. Hence, there is a very significant difference between the radiances of very thick clouds and thin clouds in the visible spectrum. The radiance values are higher for very thick clouds as compared to thin clouds. This kind of behaviour indicates a pronounced effect of optical depth on the visible portion of the spectrum. For the SWIR bands, the droplet absorption increases INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 124 approximately linearly with effective radius, and hence the asymptotic reflectance of a cloud decreases with increasing particle size. Thus the visible band contains information
