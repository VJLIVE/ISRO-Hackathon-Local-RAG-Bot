buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 14.4.2 Operational Implementation 14.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image  Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the window. 14.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment  Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.  Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.  Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned above. 14.4.2.3 Step 3: Tracking  The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of  30o of model wind. 14.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored Mid infra-red wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 223 in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Calculate wind speed and direction. 14.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution U and V component of CMV m/sec 0 90 5-6 m/sec (upper level) 4-5 m/sec
