rotation of the filter wheel is synchronized to the mirror stepping so that the mirror remains stationary during the sounding. To optimize efficiency, both forward and reverse scans are used for data collection. In addition to full earth disc coverage, flexible programme modes are provided to cater to different coverage requirements based on dynamics of atmospheric environment. The scan mirror traverses to the space-look position to get cold reference for the IR detectors. The interval between two space-looks is of the order of one minute. The space-look periodicity is decided based on the estimate of the interval required for maintaining stable background and temperature of the IR detector so that the space-look data remains valid during this period. It is proposed to have a provision within the scan mechanism to accept motion compensation signal from AOCS to compensate for the various spacecraft rates, orbit perturbations and effect of the imager mirror slew on the spacecraft. Four detectors per coarse band in north-south direction will generate four soundings per channel for every step and dwell interval of 0.1 second through a complete rotation of the filter-wheel. Thus there are a total of sixteen detectors in the instrument, twelve for IR sounding channels and four for visible channel. The normal mode of Sounder operation covers 6000km x 6000km field of view and takes approximately 160 minutes. In addition, the instrument is designed with flexible modes of operation for fast and repetitive coverage. The cold space view is used for signal referencing and as a calibration point for all bands. In-orbit multipoint calibration of the IR channel is carried out through viewing of full Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 269 aperture high emissivity internal cavity, whose physical temperature is accurately monitored at multiple locations and
