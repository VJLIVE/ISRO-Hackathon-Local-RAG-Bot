The patterns resemble to the known behaviour of the LST on these land covers, which confirms that proposed SW method is working well over full day-night cycle. 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320 00:30 02:00 03:30 05:00 06:30 08:00 09:30 11:00 12:30 14:00 15:30 20:30 22:00 23:30 INSAT-3D Land Surface Temperature, K TIME (hh:mm), GMT Desert Shrubland Cropland1 Cropland2 Figure 13. Diurnal patterns of LST derived by the split-window method from the INSAT- 3D Imager sensor over some representative land covers shown as a function of IST 18.6 Validation of Insat-3d Imager LST with K1/MODIS LST In order to check the performance of the proposed SW method, LST derived from the INSAT-3D Imager LST (3D-LST) with the SW algorithm was compared with (a) the Kalpana-1 VHRR (K1-LST) derived with the single channel algorithm and (b) MODIS LST (MOD-LST) derived with the SW method. Out of all the images, the comparison results obtained for three different times (05:30, 09:00, 21:00 GMT) corresponding to the MODIS satellite pass for a day 29th Nov. 2013 are presented in the following figures and graphs (figure 14-22).
