If S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different quality functions are computed as below : Direction Consistency Function: 1 ) ) / exp( tanh( 0.1 1 1 1 D C B S A DCF           Speed Consistency Function: 2 ) ) , ( tanh( 0.1 2 2 2 D C B S A MAX S SCF         Vector Consistency Function: 3 ) ) , ( tanh( 0.1 3 3 3 D C B S A MAX V VCF         Spacial Consistency Function: 4 ) ) , ( tanh( 0.1 2 4 4 D m C B S A MAX V PCF         In the above formulation, V S    , ,  represent the difference of direction (degrees), difference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite wind component. m V  is the length of difference vector between satellite wind component and its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. Quantities AN,BN,CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is given as QI = 0.4 PCF VCF SCF DCF    All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets (i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”.
