This considers land and pure snow as end members and compute the snow fraction of any particular pixel using reflectance value. 7.4.2.6 Snow Depth Estimation A statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). Snow depth will be estimated by using this relationship for each pixel. 7.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution SD cm - - - 1 x 1 deg 7.5.1 format of the output and the domain Geolocated Snow depth map. 40 S to 40 N; 30 E to 120 E. Snow depth INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 126 7.6 Validation 7.6.1 Comparison of INSAT 3D snow depth with field observations: INSAT-derived snow depth will continue to be compared with snow depth obtained from field locations. Sites, which were used for development of snow depth algorithm, will be used during validation, however both the activites will be carried out at different time frame. 7.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow Depth Mapping Standard statistical methods will be used to assess error of estimation, as snow depth data is available from field and satellite. 7.7 Technical issues: The snow depth of this method is limited to 27 cm of snow depth in prairie region which is expected to deteriorate further for highly rugged Himalayan mountain. It is required to develop the exponential relationship for Himalayan region based on snow depth. 7.8 Future Scope In future scope the developed statistical relationship of snow depth with fractional snow will be modified for Himalayan region as and when data will be available. Indian Meteorological Department will provide field data of snow depth and snow fraction. 7.9 References 1. Clarke, A.D. and K.J.
