threshold channel 3 temperature, the pixel is classified as fire. The fire identification algorithm flowchart is given in next subsection: Fire INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 136 8.4.1.3 Flow Chart Figure.2. Contextual Algorithm Flowchart (Note: The temperature values are indicative only. The actual value will be decided after analyzing the ground data for different regions and seasons) 8.4.2 Operational retrieval Implementation The operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: Step 1 : Conversion of gray counts to radiance and radiant temperatures Step 2 : Cloud, Land/Sea, desert and major inland water bodies masking Step 3: Solar logic flag: pixel is sunlit if the solar zenith angle is >0o and <86.5o to partition day and night pixels and have dynamic thresholds for MIR channel (3.9µm). [ e.g. T3 = (300+15*cos (solar zenith angle)] K]. Step 4: Defining of thresholds for background temperature using historical IMD data and building thresholds for different parts of the country and for different seasons. Training dataset of actual forest fires over the Indian region for MIR, TIR-I and TIR-II channels. The methodology to be followed is to first assume initial value of thresholds and then fine tune them, using visual inspection. Step 5: Implementation of three step tests (mentioned above in section 1.4.2) Step 6: Contextual Fire detection algorithm Cloud Mask T3> 309 K T3> 290 K T5> 286 K T5> 273 K T3-T5 >= 10 K T3 > µ3 + (1.5) * σ3 Predicted Fire Pixel Radiant Temp.
