when scores or people were perished in Kedarnath, Badrinath and other adjoining regions. The Fig. 13 (a) is H-E rain measurements without applying modifications and Fig. 13 (b) shows the H-E rain with modifications as described in section 5.0. We can see the mark difference in the rain intensity with corrections. Fig. 13: H-E rain in Uttrakhand on 17 June 2013 at 0200 UTC (0730 IST) (a) without modifications, (b) with modifications. The Fig. 14 (a) show the weekly averaged 13-19 June 2013 district rain from modified H-E. The state averaged rain from H-E is 316 mm. The Fig. 14 (b) is weekly averaged rain map for the same week from IMD WWR, which shows a value of 322.9 mm for the state of Uttrakhand. Thus, H-E with modifications provided in section 5.0 is able to give a very close to realistic weekly rain values over Uttrakhand.

The other case of intense rain over Himalayan regions that is presented here is that of intense rain and floods in Jammu and Kashmir during 3-5 September 2014. Figure 15 (a) shows the rain from INSAT-3D H-E on 04 September 2014 at 1500 hr without applying modifications. It can be observed that modified H-E is able to capture very intense rain in the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region (Fig. 15 (b)), which otherwise it is not able to capture in Fig. 15(a).
