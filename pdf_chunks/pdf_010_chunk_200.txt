height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa). Once the infrared tracers heights using the above three algorithms and water vapor tracers heights using the HIST and H2O methods have been calculated, the best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific infrared tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as the final height. 11.4.1.1.3 Tracking If a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).
