Altimetric distances In order to reduce confusion in discussing altimeter measurements and corrections, the following terms are used in this document as defined below: · Distance and Length are general terms with no special meaning in this document · Range is the distance from the satellite to the surface of the Earth, as measured by the altimeter. Thus, the altimeter measurement is referred to as "range" or "altimeter range," not height · Altitude is the distance of the satellite or altimeter above a reference point. The reference point used is the reference ellipsoid. This distance is computed from the satellite ephemeris data · Height is the distance of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. The sea surface height is the difference of the altimeter range from the satellite altitude above the reference ellipsoid Reference Ellipsoid Ocean Bottom Ocean Surface Orbit Range Altitude Height Reference Ellipsoid Ocean Bottom Ocean Surface Orbit Range Altitude Height Figure 1 : Altimetric distances – Altitude, Range and Height 1.4.1.2. Orbits, Revolutions, Passes, and Repeat Cycles An Orbit is one circuit of the earth by the satellite as measured from one ascending node
