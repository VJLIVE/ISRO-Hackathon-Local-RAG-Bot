Introduction Monitoring of the earth’s radiation budget is essential for improving our understanding of the earth’s climate and is changes since the radiative energy exchanges at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the earth’s surface regulate the redistribution of energy and determine the energy balance of the earth-atmosphere system. Rather than examining radiation budget as a whole, it is very important to quantify its components, namely incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation, within the atmosphere, and at the surface. Radiation budget and its different components also listed in essential climatic variables of the emerging Global Framework for Climate Services (BojinSki et al., 2014). Net surface radiation (Rn) is a key parameter for energy and mass exchange between land and atmosphere and also play a
