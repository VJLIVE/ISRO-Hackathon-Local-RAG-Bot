Babu Derivation of Inherent optical properties like chl-a, phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 443nm, back scattering coefficient, CDOM and detritus absorption coefficients at 443nm in optically complex waters 2.1 Introduction ALGORITHMS for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from ocean color sensors have evolved to a great extent over past few decades. Simplest form of the algorithm is based on empirical regression, in which chl-a concentration is correlated with the reflectance ratio at blue and green wavelength bands (O’ Reilly et al., 1998 & 2000). Empirical-based methods have been used operationally to generate global chl-a products from satellites such as Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), SeaViewing Wide Field-of- View Sensor (SeaWifs), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and so on. Constant improvement has been made in such algorithms to increase their accuracy even in low chlorophyll oligotrophic waters [3]. Although reliable and easy to implement, retrieval from these global algorithms may not be accurate in all parts of the ocean. Empirical algorithms for chl-a retrieval work on the assumption that the remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) is mainly influenced by phytoplankton and its degraded products. However, this assumption does not hold for Case-2 waters where the optically active constituents do not covary (Dierssen 2010). Due to overlapping nature
