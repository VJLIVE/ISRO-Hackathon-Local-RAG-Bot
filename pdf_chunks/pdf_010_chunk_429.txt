3 X 3 pixels for validation with measurements at tower foot-print scale may be valid for cloudless skies. But it may lead to underestimation if cloud patches are present and irregularly distributed in the surrounding pixels but not in the central pixel. It may lead to overestimation if cloudy patches are only present in the central pixel representing tower location but not in the surrounding pixels. (viii) Difference in temporal sampling The ISRO-AMS observations on incident shortwave radiation were sampled at 5 minutes interval and averaged over half-an-hour. Imager will sample with instantaneous snapshots at 30 minutes interval. Therefore, it misses out intermittent cloud presence and its spatio-temporal dynamics. These differences must have introduced some uncertainties in the validation results. Sensitivity analysis showed little influence of ozone and water vapour content on insolation at different solar zenith angles. But strong sensitivity of AOD at 550 nm was observed on insolation. Single scattering albedo ( was assumed 1.0 in the present model. In reality, it varied between 0.7603 to 0.9921 among urban-rural-ocean aerosol types (Li 1998). 20.8 Limitations of algorithm and issues in operational scenario Present algorithm has the following limitations :  The present algorithm does not consider scattering of incoming solar radiation with raindrops. Therefore, it will lead to inaccuracies in cloudy-sky conditions with rain occurrence.  Cloud has different proportions of liquid water and ice. Attenuation by them individually is not considered.  Under cloudy-sky conditions a constant precipitable water of 5.5 gcm-2 was assumed which may not be always true.  All aerosols were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Perturbations by aerosols below cloud were not considered.  Ground brightness and cloud top albedo are represented by minimum VIS TOA albedo of previous 30 days. Instead, minimum shortwave albedo needs to be used.  Apart from
