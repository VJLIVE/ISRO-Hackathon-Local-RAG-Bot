methodology for the retrieval of AMVs in staggering mode for a particular time 0500 UTC. If the selected first image is from INSAT-3D, the tracers are selected and height assignment is done, then before tracking the selected tracers in the second INSAT-3DR image, collocated tracer box in INSAT-3DR is calibrated to INSAT-3D equivalent. The process of tracer selection, height assignment and tracking is repeated for sixteen pair of images to generate sixteen pairs of raw winds which is called as wind buffer. Later, this wind buffer is used for quality control of AMVs. During the quality control, temporal, spatial consistency checks are performed with neighboring vectors extracted from the wind buffer. A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval of staggering AMVs at 0500 UTC is shown in Figure-2. To derive winds valid at 0500 UTC requires total seventeen images of 15-minute interval viz. nine images from INSAT-3D starting from 0100 UTC and eight images from INSAT-3DR starting from 0115 UTC. In the next steps INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 155 wind buffer is calculated using sixteen wind pairs. In the following step quality control technique is applied to wind buffer to estimate the final output valid at 0500 UTC. 14.4.2. Operational Implementation Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT  Since accuracy of the wind is dependent on image registration and it is assumed here that all input images are well registered. The details algorithm for registration is defined in the data product document as provided by DP team. In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured radiance into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite. Step 2: Tracer selection from image  Read first two registered images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR. 
