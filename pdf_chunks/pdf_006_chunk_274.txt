best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. Mid infra-red wind vectors INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 222 Quantities AN,BN,CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is given as QI = 0.4 PCF VCF SCF DCF    All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected. In the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets (i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”. Hundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, if we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine images. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and process is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. 14.4.2 Operational Implementation 14.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image 
