(or flagged out). In the present study, only rain flagging of data using the retrieval algorithm by Gohil et al (2006) has been attempted following procedures given by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success rates for rain-free and rainy conditions. The rain-flagging scheme has been tested with simulated data and the success rate of rain flagging under rain-free and rainy situations has been evaluated under different noise scenario. Under rain-free situations it is observed that the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for rainy cases, the missing rain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies made elsewhere. Spatial analysis of real data may further improve flagging. 28 6.1 Rain impact model and its development: An empirical rain impact model for QuikSCAT to calculate rain affected radar backscatter over ocean is given by Draper and Long (2004) as σ0 m = αrain(σ0 wind + σ0 rainstrike)+ σ0 rain 19 Where σ0 m is the measured Quikscat backscatter, σ0 wind is the rain-free wind-induced radar backscatter, σ0 rainstrike is the surface backscatter perturbation due rain striking the ocean surface, rain α is the two way atmospheric rain attenuation, and σ0 rain is the volume scattering due to falling rain droplets. The model is further simplified by summing the attenuated surface perturbation and the atmosphere scattering terms, creating a single (lump) effective rain backscatter. The resultant rain impact model is σ0 m = αrain.σ0 wind + σ0 rainy 20 with αrain = Σ 2 k=0 AkRk 21 σ0 rain = Σ 2 k=0 SkRk 22 where R (km.mm/hr) is integrated rain rate. The σ0 wind information is obtained from QSCAT-1 GMF for a known wind vector. Based on the above model, variations of atmospheric transmittance (τ=e-α) and lump rain backscatter varying with integrated rain
