the PR threshold is worked out. We examined different threshold values of PR and tried to identify most appropriate value of PR which is optimized for minimal error in the identification of rain/no-rain. This procedure led us to find a PR value of 0.6 as most appropriate value for ocean and 0.63 for land. According to Fig. 2 (a), the PR threshold of 0.6 results in about 9% false rain pixels from non-rainy pixels and 34% missing rain from rainy pixels over oceans, whereas, over land with PR = 0.63 there is about 7% false rain pixels from non-rainy and 27% missing rain from rainy pixels. We further examine how these wrongly identified pixels with PR thresholds would have likely ramification on the rain identification and measurement. Figure 3 (a) and (b) shows the average rain with vertical bars of Standard Deviation (SD) as a function of PR from the rainy dataset of ocean and land, respectively. As expected the average rain is small in lower values of PR, and increases as we go to higher values of PR. Over oceans, the average rain at PR = 0.6 is 0.13 mm/h with SD of 0.54 mm/h. We follow the same procedure over land and find that average rain at PR = 0.63 is 0.09 mm/h with SD of 0.70 mm/h. Thus, the rainy points that are classified as non-rainy would contribute only to very low rain regime (say, < ~0.7 mm/h). We further examine the non-raining point that turn raining with the PR thresholds. Figure 4 shows the cumulative probability distribution of rain rates for such pixels. The rain rate is calculated from an algorithm discussed in the next section. From the Fig. 4, we find that for oceans (open triangles) about 80% of the non-raining pixels that give false
