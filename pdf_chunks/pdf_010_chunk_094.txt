Z=0, the pixel rain rate RR is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). In fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, and hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. Thus, this same computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, and the final rain rate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to this is if the rain rate computed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not considered in the final rain rate calculation. The (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus estimated is further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and also for the precipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved for such modifications are as follows: (a) Correction for Wet/dry Environment A small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb10.7) values is carried out to account for wetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of the precipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the brightness temperature at 10.7ÔÅ≠m is set for dry or wetter environment. This is carried out in two steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the PW value to compute rain rate from (3). This is shown in Fig. 2 (a), where brightness temperature correction is additive or subtractive depends upon value of PW. In the second step, first, the (This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al.
