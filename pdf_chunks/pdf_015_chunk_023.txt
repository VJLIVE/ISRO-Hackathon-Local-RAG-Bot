The other calibration source at some times may have issues. 24 Appendix- II : INSAT-3D Geometric Calibration 1. INSAT-3D IMAGER a) IMAGER L1B and L2B products are Fixed Grid product generated using GEOS [5] projection. Per pixel geo-location can either be computed using the GEOS projection parameters or per pixel navigation provided in HDF product. For Water-vapor band this navigation information (Table 2.8) is provided at 8 Km, for IR(TIR1,TIR2,MIR) channels (Table 2.8) at 4Km. and for Visible (Table 2.8),SWIR (Table 2.8) at 1Km. The geo-location datasets and ancillary datasets (sun azimuth/elevation and sensor azimuth/elevation are scaled to reduce data size. (Ref Table 2.17 for geo-location datasets scaling information and Ref Table 2.26 for ancillary datasets scaling information). b) L1C products are Map Projection based products and the Map-Projection parameters (Table 2.18 and Table 2.19) are provided in the product for navigation of each pixel. 2. INSAT-3D SOUNDER Sounder L1B and L2B products are generated using Lat-Lon [5] navigation. The per pixel navigation information is provided at 10 Km for all 19 channels. 25 Abbreviations and Acronyms HDF Hierarchical Data Format IMD India Meteorological Department INSAT Indian National Satellite IR Infrared ISRO Indian Space Research Organisation LCC Lamberts Conformal Conic Projection NCSA National Center for Supercomputing Applications SAC Space Applications Centre SWIR Shortwave Infrared TIR Thermal
