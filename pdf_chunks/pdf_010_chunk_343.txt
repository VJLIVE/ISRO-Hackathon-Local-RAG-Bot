The theoretical basis for the detection of fog using 3.9m and ~11 m channels rely on the particular emissivity properties for fog droplets (Bendix and Bechmann, 1991) in these two channels. The small droplets found in fog are less emissive at 3.9 m than at ~11m whereas emissivities are roughly same for larger droplets (Hunt, 1973) in both the channels. The difference between brightness temperatures measured at different wavelength is tested against a threshold value and attributed to the categories of clear/ fog/other clouds etc.. The difference in brightness temperature values below 0.5 K is assumed to be cloud free and above 2.5 K is represented as opaque clouds (Ellord, 1995). However, a threshold of 5.5 K to 7.0 K has been observed for fog developed over the Indo Gangetic plains of India (Chaurasia et al, 2011) ranging from thin to thick fog case using MODIS data. This threshold will change with spatial and spectral resolution of the satellite data used for the detection of fog. Apart from this it also varies from time to time as well as from place to place and types of fog.

This test is based on the assumption that the brightness temperature of high clouds are very low (<270
