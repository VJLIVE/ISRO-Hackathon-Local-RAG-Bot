The computed brightness temperatures are analysed with SAPHIR-observed brightness temperatures to estimate the bias (slope and intercept of the linear regression equation) for each of the sounder channels. These bias-corrections will be implemented in the regression retrieval routines to remove the bias between sounder observations and the radiative transfer model computations. 4.9 Future scope: The present study does not include the sensitivity of SAPHIR channels to land emissivity variations and clouds. Inclusion of such cases will definitely improve the quality of humidity profiles. In order to
