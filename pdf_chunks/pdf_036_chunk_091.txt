impact on the sigma naught before launch. User are so advised to use this parameter with care. 5.12. Wind Speed The model functions developed to date for altimeter wind speed have all been purely empirical. The model function establishes a relation between the wind speed, and the sea surface backscatter coefficient and significant wave height. A wind speed is calculated through a mathematical relationship with the Ka-band backscatter coefficient and the significant wave height (see wind_speed_alt) using the Gourrion algorithm. The wind speed model function is evaluated for 10 meter above the sea surface, and is considered to be accurate to 2 m/s. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 60 Disclaimer : Users should use this parameter carefully because the altimeter wind speed algorithm has been tuned on Jason-1 data and should be recalculated with at least one year of SARAL/Altika data. A 10-meter (above surface) wind vector (in east-west and north-south directions) is also provided on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR (see parameters wind_speed_model_u and wind_speed_model_v). This wind speed vector is determined from an interpolation of the ECMWF model. The best accuracy for the wind vector varies from about 2 m/s in magnitude and 20 degrees in direction in the northern Atlantic Ocean, to more then 5 m/s and 40 degrees in the southern Pacific Ocean. 5.13. Bathymetry Information The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter bathymetry that gives the ocean depth or land elevation of the data point. Ocean depths have negative values, and land elevations have positive values. This parameter is given to allow users to make their own "cut" for ocean depth.
