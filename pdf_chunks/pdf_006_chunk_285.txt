Filter response function for the INSAT-3A/ Kalpana-1 WV channel was provided as input to the SABDART. Standard profile was modified by replacing specific humidity at levels above 600 hPa to represent constant relative humidty ranging from 2 to 100% with the interval of 2%. Satellite zenith angle was varied from 0 to 75 degrees at an interval of 5 degree for each constant relative humidity profile. Radiances were simulated for each set of profile and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (100 km) from SBDART for VHRR WV channel. Brightness temperature is computed from simulated radiances using the following relationship: Tb6.7 = A/ ln{(B/R) + 1} Where, A and B are constants, Tb is Brightness Temperature in K and R is Radiance in mW/cm2/Sr/µ. A bilinear regression relationship is established between ln{uth/cos()} and water vapour channel brightness temperature Tb6.7 in the form: Ln{UTH/cos()}= a + b.Tb6.7 ---- (1) Where,  is the satellite zenith angle of the corresponding pixel, and a and b are the regression coefficients. We obtain the following relationship for the UTH with satellite zenith angle and measured brightness temperature (Fig.1): UTH = cos() * exp(-a1* Tb6.7 + b1) for Tb6.7 < 240.0 ----- (2a) (with R2 = 0.9965) And, UTH = cos() * exp(-a2 * Tb6.7 + b2) for TbWV > 240.0 ----- (2b) (with R2 = 0.9989) Upper tropospheric humidity INSAT-3D ATBD Document,
