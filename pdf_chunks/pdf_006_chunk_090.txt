orientation with respect to a given incident beam become important. Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 72 Twomey et al. (1967) calculated reflectance as a function of geometric thickness for a cloud drop distribution of 6 m average radius and 1 m standard deviation. Liquid water content was 0.2 and 0.4 gm- 3, and two solar zenith angles were considered. They found that reflectance increases rapidly in hyperbolic fashion for both values of liquid water content, implying little additional increase above the thickness of 0.7 km. The effect of absorption was to increase the rate of hyperbolic convergence. Changing solar zenith angle had little effect (though at large zenith angles reflectance would approach unity), and the effects on reflectance of changing drop size distribution radius and variance were small for optical thickness,  > 100. The radiance (brightness) from the striated cloud is larger than plan parallel radiance in antisolar direction with inclined illumination (Wending, 1977). Wending tested two drop size distributions, one peaking at r ~ 5 m and other at 5 ~ 2 m, both appropriate to stratus clouds. The difference in albedo and radiance at small zenith angles were comparable to differences resulting from geometry of the cloud top; however, these also decreased with increasing optical thickness. Therefore, at optical thickness typical of precipitating clouds, texture and drop size distribution may be of secondary importance in explaining cloud brightness. McKee and Klehr (1978) with their RT (radiative transfer) model found that cloud geometry is far more important factor than drop size distribution. A composite picture emerging out of various studies in the past has proved the main factors governing cloud brightness are:  thickness  the area to volume ratio  orientation of solar beam These factors collectively called geometry, determine optical path within the
