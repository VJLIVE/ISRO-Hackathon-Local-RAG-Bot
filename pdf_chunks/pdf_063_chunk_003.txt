hours, so 2 products per day per parameter 2 The Polar products will be having data for all the features such as land, ocean or ice. However, Global and India products will be having data for pure land only. The product format is GeoTIFF. The India Products and Global Products are defined in geographic lat-lon grid. The Polar products are defined in Polar Projection as specified by NPs.mpp and SPs.mpp of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre) maps library. The EPSG codes for North and South polar projection defined by NPs.mpp and SPs.mpp are 3411 and 3412 respectively. The spatial resolution of INDIA products for all parameters is 0.02°. The spatial resolution of GLOBAL sigma0 and gamma0 products is 0.02°, whereas spatial resolution of GLOBAL brightness temperature product is 0.0625°.

The brief introduction of the format is presented in section 2.1. Relevant information about Level 4 product is placed in next sub section. 2.1 Details of GeoTIFF: Remote sensing and its applications use data in digital form. These datasets generally contain digital image along with other information which are further used for data interpretation and other applications. Different communities use these data for their required purpose. To make it convenient to the users, standards are required to store these datasets. Many image file formats like GIF, PGM, BMP, JPEG etc. are
