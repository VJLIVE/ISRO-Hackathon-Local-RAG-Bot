function. The peak of the weighting function shifts towards higher altitude as the channel frequency nears the resonance line of an absorber. Contrary to it, the peak of weighting function shifts towards surface for transparent or window channels and the atmospheric contributions also reduce to greater extents. The window channels are used for surface sensing. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 49 4.5.1.2 Retrieval techniques: The sensitivity of simulated brightness temperatures on humidity has been studied under varying atmospheric conditions. This experiment is useful in selecting the atmospheric thick-overlapping layers (TOL) influencing maximum number of channels to be considered for better retrievals. Additionally, these TOL are also innovatively utilized to derive humidity for thin-isolated layers (TIL) which otherwise will have large retrieval errors when directly derived from the channel brightness temperatures (due to broad overlapping nature of channel’s Weighting Functions (WFs) as shown in Figure 1b). Retrieval has been performed for the 7 TOL’s lying between the pressure values (1000-550) mb, (1000-400) mb, (850- 400) mb, (850-250) mb, (700-250) mb, (700-100) mb and (550-100) mb respectively on the basis of their sensitivity with SAPHIR chennels’ brightness tempratures. From these seven TOL’s, the LARH for six TIL’s lying between pressure values (1000-850) mb, (850-700) mb, (700-550) mb, (550-400) mb, (400-250) mb, and (250-100) mb have been derived. Definitions of the TOL and TIL are given below. The layer-average relative humidity (LARH) for TOL is the relative humidity (RH) averaged with respect to logarithm of pressure over a layer between two pressure limits “p1” and “p2” as defined below (8) As mentioned above, thin-isolated layers (TILs) have also been derived from two Thick-overlapping layers (TOLs) as follows. From known LARH values for two TOLs with pressure levels “p1” to “p3” and “p2” to “p3”, the LARH value for a TIL with pressure levels “p1”
