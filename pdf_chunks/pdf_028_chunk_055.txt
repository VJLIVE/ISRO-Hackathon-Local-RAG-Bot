For realizing that goal, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km up to 12 km in tropical atmospheres. However, the width of the contribution functions makes it redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complementary channel, in a window region, has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lower channels. The SAPHIR humidity sounder operates at six channels around 183.31 GHz designated as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6. given in Table-1.The final selection of layers is carried out by first building a learning data base, consisting of meteorological profiles, and brightness temperatures simulated by running a radiative transfer model on the profiles; then a multiple regression inversion scheme is applied
