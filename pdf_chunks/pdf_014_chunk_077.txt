to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme will be implemented to obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout the day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm has been operationalized (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) and daily insolation product is available at 4 km from INSAT 3D and at 8 km from Kalpana-1 spatial resolution respectively with Transverse Mercator projection routinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). 5.2.3.3 Operational proposed land surface albedo product The proposed algorithm for Rn will use the other proposed INSAT land surface albedo three hourly or daily composite product in the IMDPS operational chain. 5.3.
