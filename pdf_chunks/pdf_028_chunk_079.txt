the signal, the L2 signal is not used when the signal to noise ratio drops below a certain limit. In that case, an extrapolation of the ionosphere correction is used from higher altitudes to correct for the ionosphere (Hocke 1997, Hocke et al., 1997). 6.2.1.2 Retrieval of refractive index profile: Inverse Abel transform technique is used to retrieve refractive index profile from bending angle profile (Hajj et al., 1995; Kursinski et al., 1996; Hocke 1997). Bending angle i(ai) and the refractive index n at the perigee location of the ray is given by the forward Abel transform (e.g. Fjeldbo et al., 1971): 2 2 ( ) (ln 2 i a x i i a x dx dx n d a i      (4) Using inverse Abel transform, refractive index (n) is given as: dx a x x a n a    2 2 ) ( 1 )) ( ln(   (5) The upper limit of integral equation (5) requires knowledge of bending angle as a function of impact parameter up to the top of the atmosphere. In practice however, the estimated bending is reasonably accurate only up to a certain upper height, au. The refractivity profile is calculated by upward scaling of refractive index profile as: 6 10 )1 ) ( ( ) (    a n a N (6) The refractivity, derived as a function of impact parameter, is redefined on a mean sea level altitude relative to the Earth’s geoid so as to relate it to the geophysical parameters of temperature, pressure and water vapor partial pressure in the geoid frame.
