rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT. The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly rainfall over large areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal errors cancel each other in the aggregation procedure. Complete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A, INSAT-3D VHRR data from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been asked for. Both of them are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are given below: 4.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm: 4.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images The satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 52 temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is related to its physical temperature T by following equation: Tb =  T where,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a white body; if 0 <
