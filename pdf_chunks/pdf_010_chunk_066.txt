GOES 3.9-J.l0l band and PEBB is the equivalent blackbody emitted thermal radiation at 3.9 mm for cloud-top temperature T,. Thus, the albedo A is obtained from Eq. (4): A = L – PEBB /(S0/ π - PEBB) (4) The effective radius of cloud particles is defined as where N(r) is the number concentration of particles having radius r. The effective radius, which is dependent on the spectral albedo A at 3.9 µm, is retrieved using the results obtained by Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994), which were tabulated in a lookup table of A versus reff using an inversion of a radiative transfer model (Nakajima and King 1990). This is however, a grey are of research and the studies for microphysical properties of clouds is replaced with more innovative research element of using more physically based microwave observations of hydrometeors in synergism with the Geostationary infrared observations. Step 3. Pre-calibration of Rain Rate Using Satellite Microwave Data After the clouds are classified for their rain–no-rain baring properties, the IR radiances are to be calibrated against the near instantaneously collocated microwave rainfall measurements. The calibration with the contemporary satellites like TRMM and SSMI (whichever is available during IR acquisitions) would be highly desirable. TRMM is a low inclination tropical orbiting, while SSM/I (at present two functional) are the polar orbiting satellites. The Reff =  ( N(r)r3dr ) / (N(r)r2 dr') (5) Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 58 rainfall estimation from these satellite sensors are based on NASA’s GPROF (Goddard Profiling) Algorithm. These are most reliable microwave satellite rainfall estimates for calibrating the thermal IR radiances to estimate rainfall. A large data base of collocated INSAT-3D – IR Radiances along with TRMM/SSMI rainfall rates will be generated over land and oceanic regions. The retrieval of rainfall thus, would be carried
