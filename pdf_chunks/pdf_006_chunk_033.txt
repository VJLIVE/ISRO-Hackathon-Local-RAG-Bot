after the launch of INSAT-3D. However, to develop the preliminary version, we have used Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2D (positioned at 86.5º E) radiances to generate proxy radiances for INSAT-3D. This is due to the fact that INSAT-3D channels (TIR-1, TIR- 2 and WV), which will be used for the development of OLR algorithm, are very similar to those of FY-2D channels. INSAT-3D radiances are generated using VISSR measured radiances by accounting the difference in the radiances due to the SRF differences of FY-2D and INSAT-3D channels. We have also developed the algorithm to estimate the OLR using FY-2D measured radiances. The FY-2D radiance data from 1-15 July and 1-15 December, 2011 over the FY-2D full disk domain were collocated with CERES SSF data from all four instruments (FM1, FM2, FM3 and FM4) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The FY-2D radiance observations were averaged for 4x4 pixels (native resolution is 5 km at the sub-satellite point) to match the CERES resolution (about 20 km nadir). The criterion for the FY-2D and CERES collocations is taken as time coincidence within ± 5 minutes and a distance window of 5 km radius between the FY-2D and the CERES observations. These collocated narrowband radiances, satellite zenith angle and OLR are then used to find the empirical relationship between the OLR, satellite zenith angle and narrowband radiances (Channels; IR1, IR2 and IR3 of FY-2D). Using a radiative transfer simulation, we found empirical relationship between INSAT-3D and FY-2D radiances. The developed empirical relationship was then applied on FY-2D measured radiances to obtain the INSAT-3D radiances. These FY-2D measured radiances and the INSAT-3D simulated radiances using FY-2D measured radiances and collocated CERES OLR were used to develop the OLR algorithm (under second approach: ALG-2). In both approaches (ALG-1 and ALG-2), genetic algorithm
