of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also plays a crucial role in determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of regression coefficients for SST retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy observations data base require nearly 250 buoys distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 years. Moreover, the bias correction as mentioned above is based on the simulated brightness temperatures using ECMWF analysis profiles and PFAAST RT model. Also, ECMWF analysis profiles may also have some biases which can cause the biases in the simulated brightness temperatures. Therefore, in future we will refine this bias correction using radiosonde based atmospheric profiles. Similarly, RT models also known to have inherent biases. Hence, better RT model like OPTRON will also be explored to reduce the RT model biases.
