The second part of the above equation represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface and cloud conditions.
