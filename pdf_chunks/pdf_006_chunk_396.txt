et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available through MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other routine inputs from WRF forecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 estimates at regional scale following the steps mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based regional ETo estimates, the measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were used (Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables at 30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six sites over different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for different time period as listed in Table 6. The ETo was calculated on daily basis using AMS half-an-hour average measurements. Potential evapotranspiration INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 323 Table 6.
