the absorption due to molecular Oxygen is a minor correction needed to be quantitatively correct but not necessary for conceptual understanding. 2.5.3 Algorithm Description: Based on the above brief presentation of the formulation of both emission and scattering based radiative transfer, it is highly desirable to create a data based of input and output field vectors for the algorithm development to estimate rainfall using the MADRAS frequency channels. However the algorithm is required to be derived from radiative transfer calculations through an atmospheric cloud model (Tripoli et al.1992, Tao et al. 1993) specifying vertical distributions of ice, graupels, and other liquid hydrometeors as a function of rain rate. Such data base from cloud resolving models is very rare and is being explored. In liu of this, the algorithm is structured in two main classes. 1. Physically based: based on simulated data base as an advanced R & D and 2. Empirically based, based on the collocated matched data sets of MADRAS and Ground/Ocean truth data from various sources. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the rain detection from a passive microwave sensor. The Flow diagram is given in Fig. 2 (2.1 and 2.2) respectively. The complete algorithm steps are mentioned below: 1. Sensitivity studies through simulations of brightness temperatures for MADRAS frequency channels. Till the cloud microphysical data base is obtained, the artificially created data base along with ECMWF data will be used for radiative transfer simulations following (Liu et al.1998). 2. To ascertain the sensitivity of different channels to rainfall and other ocean and atmospheric variables, to decouple their influence for using in a rain- rate calculations in particular based on the above data base. 3. The screening process to distinguish between different land types, raining- nonraining background conditions associated with the emission and scattering characteristics of hydrometeors
