HIRS/3, and MSU and SSU have been replaced by AMSU-A and AMSU-B to improve the temperature and humidity sounding. HIRS/3 has the same spectral bands as the HIRS/2. AMSU-A uses 15 microwave channels around 23, 30, 50 and 90 GHz of oxygen absorption bands with resolution of 50 km at nadir. AMSU-B uses 5 microwave channels around 90, 150 and 190 GHz with a horizontal resolution of 17 km at nadir. New generation of infrared atmospheric sounder is the hyper-spectral sounder with thousands of channels instead of few tens of infrared bands. Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) onboard EOS-Aqua satellite was launched on May 4, 2002 and is providing a wealth of highly accurate atmospheric and surface information using 2378 high-spectral-resolution Temperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 247 infrared (3.7 – 15.4 ) channels with horizontal resolution of 10 km at nadir. AIRS along with AMSU forms a state-of-art atmospheric sounding tool for temperature profiles with accuracy of 1 C in a 1 km thick layer and humidity profile with an accuracy of 20% in 2 km thick layer in the troposphere. Aqua satellite also has MODIS with very high spatial resolution of 1 km and is providing the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. Recently, METOP satellite was launched carrying a hyper-spectral sounder IASI onboard with > 8400 channels and mission objective to achieve the temperature and humidity profiles accuracy of 1C and 10% in 1 km and 2km layers, respectively. The first sounding instrument in geostationary orbit was the GOES VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS, Smith et al. 1981) launched in 1980. This was followed by GOES-8 Sounder (Menzel and Purdom, 1994) that provides 8 km spatial resolution with 18 infrared sounding channels. Current satellite of this series, GOES-13, is launched recently in
