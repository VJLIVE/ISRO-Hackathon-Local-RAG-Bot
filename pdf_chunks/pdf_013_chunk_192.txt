a variety of applications is by no means over. Thus a suit of both supplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the highly advanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near real time basis. The main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing a Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of the innovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements from polar orbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that combines satellite passive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both data types. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few years, a number of groups world wide have embarked on development of such techniques wherein the advantages of geosynchronous viz. vast coverage and near sufficient space-time sampling, and polar passive microwave radiometers viz. more physically based retrievals, are synergistically used to INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 167 generate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g. Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. The technique has the following components: 1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m-6.7m), which corresponds well with rainfall. 2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain baring clouds. 3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR – TB’s. 4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness
