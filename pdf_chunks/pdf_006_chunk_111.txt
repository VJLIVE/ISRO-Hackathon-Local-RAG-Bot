integrated for each channel with the filter functions provided by Sensor Group and converted into radiative temperatures. The simulations applied on the "tropical maritime" subset of TIGR produced 5820 cases. Before being used to derive algorithms, the simulated radiative temperatures were filtered. To keep the simulated temperatures within realistic limits, the following thresholds were finally applied on the simulation file: Ts-T11 > 0.5C -2C < Ts < 35C W > 0.5 g/cm2 5.4.1.1.2 Inversion Methods To generate regression coefficients from the simulated brightness temperatures as per the form prescribed in equation (1), multiple regression using least square method will be adopted. 5.4.1.1.3 Single Channel SST retrieval In case of failure in any one of the thermal split channels, provisions are provided to retrieve SST using single functional channel (water vapour correction in that case will be carried out by ingesting total water vapour content externally from model output, and applying water vapour dependent SST coefficients similar to SST retrieval from INSAT- 3A/Kalpana data). If external total WV conetent is not available, climatological water vapor will be used. Single channel SST is computed as SST = a + b*Tb +c*WV Where Tb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water vapour content, a, b and c are regression coefficients generated through radiative transfer simulations and may have satellite zenith angle dependence. 5.4.1.1.4 Cloud Detection In the present algorithm, cloudy pixels are detected through thresholding and spatial coherence techniques in thermal band and the pixels are rejected based on the above criterion. Thresholding technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness temperature in thermal band is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in decreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 92 based on
