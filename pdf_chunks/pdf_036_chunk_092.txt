have positive values. This parameter is given to allow users to make their own "cut" for ocean depth. SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 61 6. Data description The main characteristics of (O)(I)GDR products are summarized in the following table. Features OGDR IGDR GDR Primary Goal To provide wind/wave data to meteorological users. Also designed to provide altimeter range, environmental and geophysical corrections together with a real-time orbit in order to make NRT SSHA available to ocean users To provide sea surface height data to operational oceanography users (with a more accurate orbit and additional environmental / geophysical corrections w.r.t. OGDR) To fulfill the project science objectives (AD 2) Geophysical level 2 product (Altimeter/radiometer), including waveforms retracking Content + available environmental and geophysical corrections + all the environmental and geophysical corrections (preliminary for some of them) + all the environmental and geophysical corrections (precise) Orbit 30 cm DORIS navigator 4 cm MOE (processed DORIS data) 3 cm POE (processed DORIS and laser data) Near-Real Time Off-Line Off-Line Delivery delay (after data acquisition) 3-5 hours 1.5 calendar days 40 days Validation Not fully validated (elementary and automatic controls only) Fully validated (in depth validation performed on a cycle basis before delivery) Validation by Experts No Yes (CNES/SALP) Structure Segment Pole to pole pass Ground Processing Centre EUMETSAT and ISRO CNES and ISRO Table 14 : Main characteristics of (O)(I)GDR products The differences between Auxiliary Data used for OGDR, IGDR and GDR products is given in section 1.1. The main fields recomputed for GDR with respect to IGDR are the following: • Due to the update of orbit data: Latitude (“latitude”) Longitude (“longitude”) Altitude (“alt”,”orb_state_flag_rest”, “alt_40hz”) Orbital altitude rate (“orb_alt_rate”) Sum of the instrumental corrections (“net_instr_corr_range”) Corrected ground retracked altimeter ranges (“range) Ionospheric correction (“iono_corr_gim”) SARAL/AltiKa Products
