Mean Dynamic Topography The MDT_CNES-CLS09 model is computed from satellite altimetry data from a variety of missions. Its main characteristics are the following : Name MDT_CNES-CLS09 Referencing time period 1993-1999 (7 years) Domain Global (78.25°S to 81.25°N) Spatial resolution Regular grid with a 1/4° (15 minutes) spacing (i.e. ~30 km) Grid 720 points in longitudes / 320 points in latitude MDT determination technique Reference of the altimeter Sea Level Anomalies, computed relative to a 7 years (1993-1999) mean profile, in order to obtain absolute measurements of the ocean dynamic topography. Combined product based on 4.5 years of GRACE data, 15 years of altimetry and in situ data (hydrologic and drifters data) Table 11 : MDT_CNES-CLS09 model characteristics This sea surface height (mean sea surface height above geoid) corresponds to mean geostrophic currents and its changes.

Geoid SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs use the EGM96 geopotential to compute the geoid [Lemoine et al., 1998]. The EGM96 geopotential model has been used to calculate point values of geoid undulation on a 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid that spans the latitude range +85.0 deg. to -85.0 deg. The EGM96 model is complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 360, and has been corrected appropriately so as SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 43 to refer to the mean tide system as far as the permanent tide is concerned [Rapp et al., 1991]. The k2 Love number used in this conversion was 0.3. The geoid undulations are given with respect
