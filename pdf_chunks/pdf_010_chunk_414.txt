- 11.3 m, 11.5 - 12.5 m) bands (4 km x 4 km). The sounder has 19 channels to provide vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity. There are 22 geophysical products which are scheduled to be available from an operational processing known as INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS). This has been successfully implemented in Kalpana-1 VHRR and INSAT 3A VHRR and CCD (Anonymous, 2005). This system provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products. Presently, there are 40 acquisitions against a maximum of 48 acquisitions per day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition are corrected for servo, lineloss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using data products scheduler. These result into automated generation of co-registered data with fixed projection having fixed number of rows and columns. Examples of diurnal data product in VIS band from INSAT 3D over Asia Mercator are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2.
