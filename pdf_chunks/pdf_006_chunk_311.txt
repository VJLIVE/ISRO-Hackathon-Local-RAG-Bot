Hybrid retrieval In a physical retrieval, the forward problem is exploited in an iterative procedure: 1. A first-guess temperature profile is chosen. 2. The weighting functions are calculated. 3. The forward problem is solved to yield estimates of the radiance in each channel. 4. If computed radiances match the observed ones (within noise) then the current profile is accepted as the solution. 5. If convergence is not achieved, the current profile is adjusted. 6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until a solution is found. An advantage of this approach is that physical processes are clearly evident at each stage. The disadvantages are that the method is computationally intensive and it requires accurate knowledge about the transmittances. It also does not exploit the known statistical properties of the atmosphere. In statistical retrieval, a training dataset, comprising radiosonde observations that are nearly coincident in time and space with satellite soundings are compiled. A relationship between the observed radiances and atmospheric profiles is established. In this approach physical processes are embedded in the statistics. Advantages of this approach are (1) the actual retrievals are computationally simple (does not use RTE) and (2) it requires no knowledge of the transmittances. It only uses the statistical properties of the atmosphere. The disadvantage is that a large training data set is necessary. Hybrid retrieval methods are in between the first two approaches. They are much like statistical retrievals, but they do not require a large training dataset. They use weighting functions like physical retrievals, but they do not directly involve integration of the RTE. Hybrid methods are easier to apply than the statistical or physical methods. They require knowledge of
