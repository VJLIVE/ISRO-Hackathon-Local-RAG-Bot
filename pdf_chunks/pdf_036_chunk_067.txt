The instruments on SARAL/AltiKa make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, ocean significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed) and tropospheric water content. Ground based laser station and DORIS station measurements of the satellite location and speeds are used in precision orbit determination (POD). The DORIS stations also measure the ionospheric electron content along the line of sight to the satellite. All of these measurements are useful in themselves, but they are made primarily to derive the sea surface height with the highest possible accuracy. Such a computation also needs external data (not collected aboard SARAL/AltiKa), e.g., atmospheric pressure, etc. In addition, instrument health and calibration data are collected onboard and used to make corrections to the main measurements and to monitor the instrument stability in the long term. This (O)(I)GDR contains all relevant corrections needed to calculate the sea surface height. For the other "geophysical variables" in the (O)(I)GDR: ocean significant wave height, tropospheric water content and wind speed, the needed instrument and atmospheric corrections have already been applied. The following sections explain the rationale for how the corrections should be applied. 4.2. Typical computation from altimetry data In this section references are made to specific (O)(I)GDR parameters by name using the name of the variable as described in the NetCDF data sets. WARNING Default values are given to data when computed values are not available (See section 6.1.2.4) so you must screen parameters to avoid using those with default values. Also you must check flag values. The related flags are given in the description of each variable (See section
