product for dissemination to agro-met advisory network Daily integrated AET will be obtained at the end of current day. For bi-weekly agro-advisories time-binned AET product of four-day (Friday-Monday) and three-day (Tuesday – Thursday)-d sum and percent anomaly from long-term mean corresponding to respective binning period will be disseminated on Tuesday and Friday morning before 11 AM.

Sensitivity analysis of STIC model simulated latent heat flux on LST and Albedo The accuracy of STIC model heavily depends on the quality of land surface temperature data due to its role in retrieving TSD and M. One-dimensional sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify the impacts
