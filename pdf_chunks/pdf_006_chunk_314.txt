Model: Remote sensing of atmospheric profiles from satellite is critically dependent on our ability to calculate observed radiances as a function of the atmospheric state. This “forward problem” is the heart of the physically based retrieval algorithms. The high rate of satellite observations requires a forward model fast enough to keep pace with the observations. Though line-by-line models exist to accurately compute atmospheric transmittances, they are far too slow to be practical. Thus fast atmospheric transmittance models are required for operational atmospheric sounding using physical methods. For INSAT-3D Sounder channels we use Pressure Layer Optical Depth (PLOD) model, also known as pressure layer fast algorithm for atmospheric transmittances (PFAAST), developed by Hanon et al (1996). This model has been widely used for profiles retrieval algorithm for GOES, NOAA- TOVS/ATOVS, Aqua-AIRS/MODIS, etc (Li et al. 2000; Li et al. 2001 etc, Ma et al. 1999). The radiance recorded by the satellite sensor is the convolution of incident spectral radiance function with instrument’s spectral response function (SRF). Computing simulated radiances by calculating the monochromatic radiances and then convolving it with the instrument’s SRF takes too much time to be practical. In fast model PLOD a polychromatic approximation for the transmittances is made which directly computes the approximate convolved radiances. The monochromatic radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere, excluding scattering and reflection, is given by ) 3 ( )] ( )1 ( )).[ ( ( ) ( )) ( ( 1           L i z z z s i i i T B L s T B R     Where, the atmospheric layers are numbered 1 to L from space to surface respectively.
