solar radiation reaching horizontal plane is known as the incident solar radiation at surface Rs. The Rs should be in MJm-2day-1. 19.4.7 Net solar or net shortwave radiation   ns R The net shortwave radiation is net balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation in short wave range and is given by, S ns R R ) 1(    ns R =net solar or shortwave radiation (MJm-2day-1) = albedo which is 0.23 for reference grass (e.g. Alfalfa) S R = incoming solar radiation [MJm-2day-1] received at ground surface 19.4.8 Net longwave radiation   nl R The longwave radiation emission is proportional to the absolute temperature of the surface raised to the fourth power as per Stefan-Boltzmann law. The net radiation leaving the earth's surface is however, less than emitted due to the absorption and downward radiation from the sky. The atmospheric constituents like water vapour, clouds, carbon dioxide and dust are absorbers and emitters of longwave radiation. Their concentration should be vital for assessing the net outgoing radiation. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is corrected for water vapour and cloudiness by assuming the concentration of other atmospheric constituents remain constant.
