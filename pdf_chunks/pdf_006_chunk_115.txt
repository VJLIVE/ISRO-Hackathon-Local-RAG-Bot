SST and the climatology is strictly below 30 C and the channel 5 standard deviation is lower or equal to 10 C. If both the criterion are not true, flag value is put as 2. In case of cloudy pixel, flag value is 1. Pixels over land are flagged as 4. 5.5 Outputs SST maps and data (HDF5) will be available every half hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and seasonally Parameter Unit Min Max Theoretical Accuracy Resolution SST(day) Kelvin 285 310 ~0.8 K (with 0.12 K noise) Pixel (~4 km) SST(night) Kelvin 285 310 ~0.5 K (with 0.12 K noise) Pixel(~4 km) 5.5.1 format of the output and the domain HDF5 datasets: latitude , longitude , sst, flag Domain : 40 to 40 N, 30 E to 120 E 5.6 Validation Validation of the derived SST will be done using all the available data from buoys, special cruise by ORV SagarKanya and available similar products from various satellite missions. Validation will be jointly done with IMD. 5.6.1 Data required Buoy or ship data for SST validation should consists of following parameter  SHIP/Buoy ID  Location of the measurement  Time of the measurement  SurfaceWind speed and direction  Surface Relative humidity  SST  Depth at which measurement is taken  Instrument accuracy of SST. 5.6.2 Methods of validation The in situ records are first temporally matched-up against the INSAT extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the two data sources, the Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 96 absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at which that location is viewed by the INSAT (i.e., the matchup time window) is restricted to a maximum of ±30 minutes or ±15 minutes. In situ records that do not
