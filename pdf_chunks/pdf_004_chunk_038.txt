from the earth’s surface is dependent on the roughness at the scale of the radar wave length, the incidence angle, and the dielectric properties of the surface, which for sea ice means ice salinity, temperature, air inclusion, liquid water fraction in snow and ice, and snow cover (Haarpaintner et al, 2004). At low wind speeds, horizontal polarization backscatter from the ocean is generally lower than backscatter 33 from ice but higher wind speed may produce ambiguities for ice-ocean discrimination because ice and ocean may exhibit similar mean backscatter values. Haarpaintner et al (2004) have given an approach (referred hereafter as HA) for sea-ice delineation making use of active polarization ratio (APR) and radar backscatter values. The APR is given as APR = (σ0H - σ0V)/ (σ0H + σ0V) 24 Where σ0H, σ0V are radar backscatter on linear scale. Based on a number of criteria given in HA, the ice-flagging scheme is being considered for Oceanat-2 scatterometer. A limited number of criteria given in HA used here, are given in table (5). Table 5: Ice-ocean thresholds Parameter Value APR >-0.02 V0V >-25 dB V0H >-25 dB Data satisfying these conditions is treated as ice Some of the results, on the basis of a limited criterion of HA, obtained from Quikscat radar backscatter products (BYU products) are presented here as a preliminary effort towards sea-ice flagging for Oceansat-2 (Rao, 2007). Shown in figure (17) are APR values obtained using Quikscat data for different dates during year 2000 indicating the presence of sea ice. (a) (b) Figure 17: Quikscat backscatter BYU product derived APR over Southern Polar region indicating sea-ice coverage for different dates (a) 11-02-2000, and (b) 17-08-2000 34 However, over ocean, some of the spurious data indicating sea-ice are also seen which may be due to higher winds as well as
