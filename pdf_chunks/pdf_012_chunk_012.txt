hosted by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are first temporally matched-up against the INSAT-3D/3DR extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the two data sources, the absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at which that location is viewed by the INSAT-3D/3DR (i.e., the matchup time window) is restricted to a maximum of Â±15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the stipulated time window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal matchup subsequently have to pass a spatial test. The figures 4(a) and 4(b) are showing the scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST retrieved through new and operational algorithm with respect to concurrent in-situ SST measurements while figures 5(a) and 5(b) are showing the same for INSAT-3DR SST.

This clearly indicates an improvement in SST when retrieved using proposed algorithm than the operational SST. The correlation coefficient also shows an improvement. SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 14 3.5.1.2 Comparison with MODIS/Aqua: A preliminary comparison of SST retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm for both INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with MODIS/Aqua SST for the same period of 11-18, December 2017. Figures (6-7) are showing the density scatter plot for both the products: new as well as operational for both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR sensors.
