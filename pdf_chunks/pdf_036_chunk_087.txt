be considered to be in equilibrium with the tide generating forces. Then, the surface is parallel with the equipotential surface, and the tide height is proportional to the potential. The two proportionality constants are the so-called Love numbers. It should be noted that the Love numbers are largely frequency independent, an exception occurs near a frequency corresponding to the K1 tide constituents due to a resonance in the liquid core [Wahr, 1985 and Stacey, 1977]. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR computes the solid earth tide, or body tide, as a purely radial elastic response of the solid Earth to the tidal potential (see parameter solid_earth_tide.) The adopted tidal potential is the Cartwright and Tayler [1971] and Cartwright and Edden [1973] tidal potential extrapolated to the 2000 era, and includes degree 2 and 3 coefficients of the tidal potential. The permanent tide (zero frequency) term is excluded from the tidal potential that is used to compute the solid earth tide parameter for the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR. The elastic response is modeled using frequency independent Love numbers. The effects of the resonance in the core are accounted for by scaling the tide potential amplitude of the K1 tidal coefficient and some neighboring nodal terms by an appropriate scale factor. 5.9.4. Pole Tide The pole tide is a tide-like motion of the ocean surface that is a response of both the solid Earth and the oceans to the centrifugal potential that is generated by small perturbations to the Earth's rotation axis. These perturbations primarily occur at periods of 433 days (called the Chandler wobble) and annual. These periods are long enough for the pole tide displacement to be considered to be in equilibrium with the forcing centrifugal potential. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a single field for the radial geocentric pole tide displacement of the ocean surface
