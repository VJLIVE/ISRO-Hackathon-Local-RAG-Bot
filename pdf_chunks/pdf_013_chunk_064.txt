processing of past years INSAT 3D and ancillary data to generate long term daily, time-binned AET, mean and percent anomaly from mean. 4.5.3. Steps for operational implementation The following steps need to be followed for operational implementation of evapotranspiration over land (AET) product generation: i) Three-hourly temperature data at 2-meter surface height from hourly forecast from WRF (ASCII format) at 0.03 o X 0.03 o / 0.05 o X 0.05 o spatial grid. ii) Conversion of all ASCII outputs of (i) and (ii) to raster of dimension approx. 0.04o X 0.04o grid resolution as per the INSAT 3DR net radiation product iii) The sub setting of LST, current-day noon-time albedo, sliding monthly albedo and NDVI composites, net radiation products as per the bounds of Asia sector products. iv) Integration of INSAT derived clear sky net radiation, LST with 2-D surface of WRF variables in to physical model to generate clear sky latent heat flux. (λEclr) v) Integration of INSAT derived cloud mask and cloudy-sky net radiation and recovered LST along with 2-D surface WRF variables into physical model to generate cloudy-sky latent heat flux (λEcld) vi) Computation of daily evapotranspiration in mm day-1 from hourly latent heat flux and time- binned AET product for four days (Friday – Monday) and three days (Tuesday – Thursday). vii) Generation of long-term daily, time-binned, mean AET in mm depth of water to be updated every year), percent anomaly from mean INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 56 4.6. Outputs Product latency of time-binned product for dissemination to agro-met advisory network Daily integrated AET will be obtained at the end of current day. For bi-weekly agro-advisories time-binned AET product of four-day (Friday-Monday) and three-day (Tuesday – Thursday)-d sum and percent anomaly from long-term mean corresponding to respective binning period will be disseminated on Tuesday
