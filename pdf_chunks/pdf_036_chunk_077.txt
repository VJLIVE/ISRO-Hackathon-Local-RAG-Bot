be reduced, etc. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MSS model that is generated from multiple satellite altimetry missions (see mean_sea_surface parameter). Longer time spans of data that become available in the future, along with improved data handling techniques will improve the current MSS models. Care must be given to the retention of high frequency signal and the reduction of high frequency noise. 5.5. Mean Dynamic Topography A Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) represents the Mean Sea Surface referenced to a geoid and corrected from geophysical effects. A MDT is given as a grid with spacing consistent with the altimeter and other data used in the generation of the grid values. The MDT provides the absolute reference surface for the ocean circulation. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MDT model (see mean_topography parameter) that is a combined product recovering several years based on GRACE mission, altimetry and in situ data (hydrologic and drifters data). 5.6. Geophysical Corrections The atmosphere and ionosphere slow the velocity of radio pulses at a rate proportional to the total mass of the atmosphere, the mass of water vapor in the atmosphere, and the number of free electrons in the ionosphere. In addition, radio pulses do not reflect from the mean sea level but from a level that depends on wave height and wind speed. The errors due to these processes cannot be ignored and must be removed. Discussions of these effects are given in Chelton et al. [2001]. 5.6.1. Dry Troposphere The propagation velocity of a radio pulse is slowed by the "dry" gases and the quantity of water vapor in the Earth's troposphere. The "dry" gas contribution is nearly constant and produces height errors of approximately -2.3 m. The water vapor in the troposphere is quite variable and unpredictable and produces a height calculation error
