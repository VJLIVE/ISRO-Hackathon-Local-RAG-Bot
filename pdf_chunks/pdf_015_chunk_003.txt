in one Visible (VIS) in 0.55 to 0.75 µm range and five infrared channels. The specifications of the payload are summarized in Table 1.2.1. There are two flexible modes of operations possible with the IMAGER payloads:  Full frame mode scans 18° E-W x 18°N-S covering the entire earth disk and some space around. The acquisition time for full globe is around 26 minutes. So daily 48 acquisitions are possible in every half hourly interval.  Program mode covering 18° in E-W direction; N-S coverage can be defined in terms of the number of lines to be scanned 2 Table 1.1 Payload Specification for IMAGER Spectral Channels Spectral Range (µm) Resolution (km) Quantization bits VIS 0.55 – 0.75 1 10 SWIR 1.55-1.70 1 10 MIR 3.80-4.00 4 10 WV 6.50-7.10 8 10 TIR 1 10.3-11.3 4 10 TIR 2 11.5 – 12.5 4 10 SOUNDER The Sounder onboard INSAT 3D has 18 Infra Red channels, out of which 7 are in long wave IR (LWIR), 6 in short wave IR (SWIR) and 5 in medium wave IR (MWIR) bands and 1 Visible Channel.
