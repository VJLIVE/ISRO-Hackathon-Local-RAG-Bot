from the SSM/I. In this study, separate relationships were developed for land and ocean, improving the sensitivity to scattering. In addition, the original relationships derived by Grody (1991) used antenna temperatures which were convolved to the 19 GHz FOV; the updated study used the more conventional Tb values and preserved the original SSM/I footprint sizes, allowing for easy implementation by the scientific community. An alternative method to retrieve rain rate has been to calibrate the SI with ground-based radar measurements from the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Ferraro and Marks, 1995). Similar to the oceans, the following relationship would be attempted to work best for global oceans: RR mm/hr . = a SIL where RR is in mm/hr. Since these relationships increase rapidly for higher values of SIL, any retrieval above 35 mm/hr is set to 35 mm/hr. Although somewhat arbitrary, practice shows that this is the upward limit of rain rates retrievable from the 85 GHz measurements (e.g., the maximum mean rain rate that could exist in a 13 by 15 km FOV). Using the 10K minimum threshold for the SIL values, the minimum retrievable rain rate is approximately 0.5 mm/hr. This algorithm was implemented by FNMOC in 1995 as the operational SSM/I rain rate algorithm, and continues to operate in that capacity. In addition, the monthly derived rainfall from this algorithm (Ferraro, 1997) is used as a component of the GPCP blended analysis (Huffman et al., 1996)The MADRAS instrument will contain nearly similar frequencies to the SSM/I. Initially the SSM/I based coefficients will be used and later fine tuned for MADRAS, based on a large data base to be co-located during raining episodes. 2.6.
