The rms difference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of these similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, the correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, whereas that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high value of 0.93. Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that between TRMM Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 81 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-E is also attempted and is shown in the Table 1.6.2. 4.6.2 Validation of daily 0.25ox0.25o grided rain The comparisons in section 4.6.1 are carried out in weekly meteorological sub-division scales. The rain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few seconds to any time scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random stochastic process. Therefore, rain comparisons in shorter time scales and from observations in different spatial scales lead to large errors (Piyush et al.,
