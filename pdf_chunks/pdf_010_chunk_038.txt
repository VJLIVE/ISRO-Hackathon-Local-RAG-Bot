The following data can be used for validation:  The OLR data from different satellites having broadband sensors (e.g CERES on Aqua, Teraa and NPP, ScaRaB on Megha- Tropiques)  FY2D satellite derived OLR  AIRS Derived OLR Data Resolution Source OLR, CERES 20 Km NOAA OLR, AIRS & IASI 45 Km NASA OLR, FY2D 5 Km CMA OLR, MT-ScaRaB 50 Km ISRO 3.6.2 Method of validation The root mean square Error (RMSE) and bias will be computed by comparing the retrieved OLR with that of observed OLR. 3.7 Technical Issues  Limitations of narrowband to broadband conversion (ADM)  Non-availability of in-situ measurements. 3.8 Future Scope These coefficients may need fine-tuning based on the comparison between observed OLR and the OLR computed using the INSAT-3D measured radiances. 3.9 References 1.
