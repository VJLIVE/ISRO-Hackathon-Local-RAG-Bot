temperature at 500 hPa. Environmental temperature at 500 hPa is the retrieved temperature at 500 hPa. Lifted Application parameters from sounder derived products INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 373 Index is then the difference between the 500 hPa parcel temperature and environmental temperature. Moist adiabatic lapse rate (saturated adiabatic lapse rate) is given by (Meteorology for Scientists and Engineers, by Roland Stull, 2000) )) / ( 1( ) ( 2 T bq P cq aT P T      Where a=0.28571, b=1.35 x 107 K2, c=2488.4 K, T – Temperature in K, P – Pressure in kPa, q – specific humidity in g/Kg. Starting at a temperature T1, at pressure P1, temperature at pressure P2, can be written as ) ( 1 2 1 2 P P P T T T      The difference P2-P1 should be small enough so that the moist lapse rate does not change significantly. Thus one can estimate parcel temperature step by step at higher levels, by this method. Error in the Lifted Index calculated this way will depend on error in retrieved temperature and humidity profile. 3.4.2 Operational Implementation Implementation of the above described algorithm is self explanatory. 3.5 Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution LIS oC - - 2-3oC 0.5 x 0.5 deg 3.5.1 Format of the output and the domain lat, lon, LIS Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E. 3.6 Method of Validation 3.6.1 Data Required Collocated radiosonde observations 3.6.2 Methods of Validation Direct comparison with LI calculated from collocated radiosonde observations. 3.7 Technical Issues (Limitation etc.) Accuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles from the sounder. 3.8 References Hayden, C.
