and robustness of the sampling variability. The flowchart of generating analysed chlorophyll fields for the global ocean is given in Figure 4. Figure 4 : Flow chart of the methodology for generating analysed chlorophyll fields 3.5. Operational Implementation: The implementation steps that are to be followed are mentioned below and is also shown in Figure 5. Step 1: Daily fields of ocean surface chlorophyll output generated from MOM5- TOPAZ coupled model in MOSDAC is considered as the model background data. Step 2: OCM-3 GAC chlorophyll data downloaded from Bhunidhi NRSC site is considered as the observation. Step 3: Checking the availability of model and OCM-3 data. If both data sets are available, following steps (steps 4 â€“ 6) will be carried out to generate final product of analysed chlorophyll field. Step 4: Generation of daily gridded fields of OCM-3 Chlorophyll combining all GAC products for the particular day. Step 5: Preparation of 250 ensembles from model background field using Bootstrap technique. Step 6: Generation of daily analysed fields of chlorophyll for the global ocean using Particle Filter technique. Figure 5: Steps involved in the Operational Implementation 3.6 Output: Daily fields of chlorophyll from coupled model is improved using particle filter technique incorporating OCM-3 derived chlorophyll data. Therefore, the output generated is available at the same temporal and spatial resolution of the coupled model, which is at 25 km spatial resolution and daily. 3.6.1. Format of Output : The outputs are available as images (jpeg format) and product file (nc format). The analysed chlorophyll fields displayed in the Gallery section in the MOSDAC is shown in Figure 6 for the day 25 January 2024. Figure 6. A typical standard output available in MOSDAC Gallery section 3.7 Initial Validation For inter-comparison and validation, independent observations of satellite and Bio- Argo buoys are
