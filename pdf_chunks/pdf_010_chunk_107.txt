in the infrared, the processes at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear incomplete in places as research continues to improve our understanding of the processes at work. Subsequent revisions of the document will reflect new knowledge and, it is hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here. 5.2.2 Objective Development of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi channel Imager data from INSAT-3D. 5.3 Inputs 5.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Land /Sea Mask Pixel ( ~4 km) 1 pixel USGS(available) 5.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Parameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of Channel-5 (10.2-11.3 m) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of Channel-6 (11.5-12.5 m) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Radiometric and geometric corrected gray count values of Channel-3 (3.8 – 4.0 m) pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data by DP Gray value to brightness temperature - - 0.3 K Derived by DP Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 89 conversion lookup table Geolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP Satellite Zenith angle pixel Derived by DP Solar Zenith angle pixel Derived by DP Cloud Flag Pixel - - Cloud Routine 5.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Climatological SSTdata 1 X 1 deg 0.5 K Reynolds Climatological WV data 1 X 1 deg 5 mm NVAP Total water vapour (In case of failure of any one of the split thermal channel) 0.5 X 0.5 deg 5 mm Model output, IMD 5.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications 5.4.1 Overview 5.4.1.1 Theoretical Background Radiance from
