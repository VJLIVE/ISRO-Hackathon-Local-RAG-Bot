location of the earth depending on the position of GPS and LEO satellites. The exact location over which radio occultation measurements are possible, require prior knowledge of GPS and Megha-Tropiques orbit. One may expect 500 to 800 occultations per day spread in the domain (30S-30N; 180W-180E) with dense occurrence around 10-20S/N.  Theoretically, the GPS-RO data of reliable quality may range from 0 – 60km in the neutral atmosphere. Practically, the measurements are reliable between altitudes of 5 to 30 km height, irrespective of the atmospheric dynamics. Since, ROSA coverage will be confined to the tropics where moisture gradients creates multipath conditions, advanced techniques to retrieve refractivity profile by an open-loop processing as implemented in global missions like COSMIC, GRAS etc., may be required to penetrate to near surface altitudes ~ 0.1 km or less. Examination of COSMIC profiles over the ocean indicates that more than 90% of the radio occultation refractivity measurements are available up to an altitude of 0.5 km from the mean sea level.  The algorithm uses the CIRA-86 COSPAR upper-air atmospheric model data of zonal mean temperature and pressure available up to 120km for the computation of hydrostatic integral. The accuracy of the upper-air data as quoted by COSPAR has been assumed suo motu, in the absence of ways to validate them.  The monthly mean surface temperature, pressure and altitude data are generated from NCEP analyses at global grid of 1deg x1 deg resolution as first guess estimates. The standard deviations (all months and for 30S- 30N) of mean surface temperature and mean surface pressure are ~ 1K and 0.05-2.0hPa respectively. To get a more accurate first guess, the use of daily forecast of NCEP, nearest to ROSA occultation event time and location is imperative. 6.7 References: 1. Ao, C.O., T. K. Meehan, G.A.
