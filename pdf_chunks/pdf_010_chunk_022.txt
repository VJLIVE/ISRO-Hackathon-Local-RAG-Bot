OLR Baseline Document 3.2 Introduction The total amount of the thermal radiation (4 – 100 µm wavelength bands) that is emitted from the earth-atmosphere system to the outer space is called outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Besides the broadband instruments that are dedicated for observing the OLR, for example, Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), there are many algorithms that estimate OLR by converting the narrowband radiances into broadband flux (OLR; Ellingson et al. 1989, Ellingson et al. 1994, Singh et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010). Algorithm to estimate the OLR from the Geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) imager observed WV (6.5 – 7.1 µm) and thermal infrared (TIR-1; 10.3 – 11.3 µm and TIR-2; 11.5 – 12.5 µm) radiances has been developed in the frame of the IMDPS. The developed algorithm will be used operationally when data from the INSAT-3D satellite will be available. Algorithm to estimate the OLR is developed using two basic approaches: i. In the first approach, a large database of spectral radiance fields and broadband flux (OLR) built using Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used to develop the algorithm. The radiative transfer computations are performed at 19400 wavelengths covering the thermal region (4–100 m) and for 4704 realistic conditions of the Earth–atmosphere system. ii. In the second approach, INSAT-3D imager radiances collocated (in space and time) with CERES OLR available from Terra and Aqua satellites, are used to develop the algorithm. Outgoing longwave radiation INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 31 3.2.1 Overview and background The earth and its atmosphere absorb the shortwave (SW) radiation coming from the sun and emit thermal longwave (LW) radiation to space. These two radiation streams can be represented approximately by blackbody radiation of 6000K for the solar SW and 290K for the terrestrial (LW). The balance between the
