using satellite observations. These algorithms have been used in global cloud climatology over long time periods and thus have overcome some of the difficulties facing the INSAT cloud mask algorithm. A wide variety of scientists have discussed the physical basis behind each of the spectral tests and applications to satellite or aircraft data are present in a variety of publications (Ackerman et al. [1997]. The INSAT cloud mask algorithm builds on these past works by combining the different tests into a single unified algorithm. Operational GOES products by NESDIS also require cloud detection, an algorithm referred to as “cloud clearing.” In this application, an array of n×n contiguous pixels is categorized as clear, cloudy or unusable. The clear arrays are subcategorized as truly clear and clear/cloudy. Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 17 In an approach similar to the ITPP-5 method (Minnis et al 1995), clear conditions are determined based on brightness thresholds, difference thresholds, and comparison of observations with first guess profiles. 2.2.2 Objective The objective of this algorithm is to discriminate the cloudy pixels from the clear pixel in the image data. 2.3 Inputs 2.3.1 Static Data Parameter Resolution Accuracy Source Land sea mask 4 km - USGS file (Available) 2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) Note: The BTmax (11µ) for each time, user defined no. of previous days (default 20 days) images of TIR –1 and TIR-2 for all times of the day will be needed. These Btmax images are generated for each time using previous 20 days data.
