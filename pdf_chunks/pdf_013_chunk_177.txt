employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This search will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 156 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control  The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region.  Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.  Use EUMETSAT automatic quality control method to get the QI  Calculate wind speed and direction. 14.5.
