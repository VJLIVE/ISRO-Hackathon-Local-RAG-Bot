further in algorithm. Step 2 : Cloud elimination This step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D(R) image. Cloud screening is based on SWIR reflectance/temperature data, or cloud mask product will be used subject to its availability, and this will help to clear cloudy pixels. Step 3 : Generation of NDSI image Normalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio of visible and SWIR channel as given below; NDSI = (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) / (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) where R is the reflectance of the respective channel. Step 4: Generation of Fractional snow pixel A developed relationship will be used to convert INSAT 3D coarse resolution pixel into fractional snow cover pixel for the respective pixel. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 22 Accuracy of SCM and FSC is expected to be approximately 90% or better. 1.5. Outputs Parameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution SCM 4*4 km2 - - - Pixel level FSC km2 - - - Pixel level 1.5.1. Format of the output and the domain Geolocated Snow cover and fraction snow cover map of INSAT dataset, focusing on Hindukush- Karakoram-Himalayan region. 1.6. Validation and Error Analysis 1.6.1. Field Spectroradiometer data Field data of snow and other ambient objects will be collected and analyzed for the wavelength bands in INSAT 3DR. These value will be used to verify NDSI threshold to discriminate snow from other existing land cover features. 1.6.2. Visual Snow Cover Map Snow cover pixel will be identified visually and will be verified on automated snow cover product generated using INSAT 3D(R). This may also be extended to visually map snow covers and validate these map with operationally derive snow cover products. 1.6.3. Comparison of INSAT 3D(R) snow maps with AWiFS snow products INSAT-derived snow maps
