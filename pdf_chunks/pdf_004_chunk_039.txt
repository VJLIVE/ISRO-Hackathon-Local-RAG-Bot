(a) (b) Figure 17: Quikscat backscatter BYU product derived APR over Southern Polar region indicating sea-ice coverage for different dates (a) 11-02-2000, and (b) 17-08-2000 34 However, over ocean, some of the spurious data indicating sea-ice are also seen which may be due to higher winds as well as APR calculated at the edge of inner beam swath. Given here is only an introduction to the activity while detailed plan is being worked out separately (not a part of wind retrieval). 7.0 Initial phase validation: This aspect to some extent is taken care during GMF development phase which will also include limited validation of GMF and the derived winds. However, calibration/validation activities are being pursued separately. 8.0 Limitations: The major limitation is that the retrievals under cyclonic conditions are highly erroneous in terms of wind speed and direction as the cyclones are mostly associated with rain. This needs cyclonic data to be properly identified and processed in a proper manner taking care of rain (simultaneous retrievals). Apart from this, regions with highly variable wind fields like fronts, cols, vortices and others in the presence of large noise the directional ambiguities may not be properly filtered out. Due to different processes to be incorporated for outer and nadir regions, discontinuities in the direction fields may occur in some cases. 9.0 Acknowledgements Authors wish to thank Dr. R. R.
