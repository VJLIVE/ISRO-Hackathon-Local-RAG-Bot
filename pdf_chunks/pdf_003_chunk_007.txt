derived chlorophyll for the global ocean is shown for 28 November 2023. More than 200 GAC scenes were considered to generate gridded OCM-3 product for the mentioned day. Figure 2: Flowchart of gridded 4 km OCM-3 chlorophyll data for the global ocean. Figure 3: Gridded 4 km OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll for the global ocean for 28 November 2023. Some of the GAP scenes for the same day are also shown. More than 200 GAC scenes were considered to generate gridded product for a day. 3.3. Theoretical Background of Particle Filter technique The algorithm used for the assimilation of satellite derived CHL into the coupled model is a state of the art ensemble based particle filter technique. Particle filtering uses a set of particles to represent the posterior distribution of a stochastic process given noisy and/or partial observations. The novelty of the scheme lies in the fact that, unlike other ensemble technique, particle filter does not impose any restriction on the form of the PDF of the background field. Thus, its superiority in nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems makes it widely acceptable to many applications (van Leeuwen, 2009, 2010). The realistic implementation of Particle filter is explained in Mattern et al., 2013; Ratheesh et al., 2016 and Bhowmick et al 2019. Particle filtering method approximate the posterior distribution using randomly extracted particle sets from the posterior probability. The central concept is to determine the distribution of the system’s state variable with minimal variability or uncertainty, and is achieved by updating the probability distribution of the state variable based on observed data and system dynamics. The cornerstone of particle filter is Bayes’s theorem which reads 𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) = 𝑝𝑑(𝑑|𝜓)𝑝𝑚(𝜓) 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) (1) Where: 1. 𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) is the Posterior distribution, representing the true state of the system generated using model simulated chlorophyll (𝜓) given chlorophyll observations
