Quantitative assessment of the MIR winds product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation Parameter Lat. Lon.

At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts of the report. i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite winds
