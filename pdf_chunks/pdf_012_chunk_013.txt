been carried out with MODIS/Aqua SST for the same period of 11-18, December 2017. Figures (6-7) are showing the density scatter plot for both the products: new as well as operational for both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR sensors. (a) (b) Fig. 6: Density plot of retrieved INSAT-3D SST with MODIS (a) Operational (b) New SST (a) (b) Fig. 7: Density plot of retrieved INSAT-3D SST with MODIS (a) Operational (b) New SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 15 The quantitative comparison in terms of correlation coefficient, mean difference (bias), the standard deviation of the difference (Std) with respect to MODIS SST has also been shown in same figures. From the above figures it is clear that both the bias and Std of new SST are less than that of operational SST when compared with MODIS. Therefore, SST accuracy is improved when retrieved using the proposed algorithm. 3.5.2.3 Comparison with GHRSST DAILY Products: An initial comparison of daily SST products retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm for both INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with GHRSST daily SST products for the same period of 11-18, December 2017. The comparison has been shown by the spatial plots of the differences in both the SST products. The following figures (8) and (9) are showing the spatial plots of the differences for INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, respectively for 11th December 2017. (a) (b) Fig. 8: Difference of daily INSAT-3D SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New It can be clearly seen from the above figures (8) and (9) that except some locations the difference between INSAT-3D/3DR SST and GHRSST is within Â±1K when retrieved through proposed algorithm. While the difference between operational SST and GHRSST products is as high as 2.5 to 3K in case of INSAT-3D and as low as -2.5 to -3K in case of
