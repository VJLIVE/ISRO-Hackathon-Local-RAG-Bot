1° trial direction interval starting with wind speed search regime ∆WS1i at χn-δχ trial direction 6) At precision direction solutions χn prcn, find Wn m and NSDn through step 2 exploiting ∆WS1i values at χn-δχ trial direction. The derived precision solutions of wind speed, direction and corresponding NSD are denoted by Wn mprcn, χn prcn and NSDn prcn, respectively 7) Rank the wind vector solutions on the basis of NSD values. The wind vector solution having minimum NSD is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. For comparison purpose, the MLE algorithm is also implemented in following steps: 1) First, assume a trial wind direction interval of 2°, denoted by δχ. For χ=0°, find wind speed denoted by WS1 corresponding to minimum MLCF determined as per equation (4) using wind speed varied over full GMF range with 1.0 m/s interval denoted by δWS1. 2) Evaluate wind speed regime ∆WS1 from WS1 using the following equation. ∆WS1 = WS1 ± 2δWS1. δχ 14 3) Find wind speed denoted by WS2 through searching MLCF minimum using wind speed regime ∆WS1with 0.2 m/s wind speed interval termed as δWS2. 4) Find precision wind speed WS2prcn through minimum of quadratic fit of MLCF around WS2 with winds between WS2 ± δWS2 and recalculate MLCF2prcn for WS2prcn at χ=0°. 5) Truncate WS2prcn with 0.2 m/s precision denoted by WStrnc and find the wind speed regime for the next trial direction χ is given as ∆WS2 = WStrnc ± 2δWS2. δχ 15 18 6) Repeat steps (3 through 5) for the remaining trial directions varied with an interval δχ with wind corresponding to wind speed regimes given by equation (14). 7) Find vector solutions by searching minima of MLCF2prcn along trial direction. Denote number of solutions as NS and their serial numbers as n. The solutions
