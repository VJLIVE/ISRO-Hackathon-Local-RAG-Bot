of approximately 83 m and -106 m. Although the geoid undulations are primarily long wavelength phenomena, short wavelength changes in the geoid undulation are seen over seamounts, trenches, ridges, etc., in the oceans. The calculation of a high resolution geoid requires high resolution surface gravity data in the region of interest as well as a potential coefficient model that can be used to define the long and medium wavelengths of the Earth's gravitational field. Surface gravity data are generally only available in certain regions of the Earth and spherical harmonic expansions of the Earth's gravitational potential are usually used to define the geoid globally. Currently, such expansions are available to degree 360 and in some cases higher. For ocean circulation studies, it is important that the long wavelength part of the geoid be accurately determined.

Mean Sea Surface A Mean Sea Surface (MSS) represents the position of the ocean surface averaged over an appropriate time period to remove annual, semi-annual, seasonal, and spurious sea surface height signals. A MSS is given as a grid with spacing consistent with the altimeter and other data used in the generation of the grid values. The MSS grid can be useful for data editing purposes, for the calculation of along track and cross track geoid gradients, for the calculation of gridded gravity anomalies, for geophysical studies, for a reference surface to which sea surface height data from different altimeter missions can be reduced, etc. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MSS model that is generated from multiple satellite altimetry missions (see mean_sea_surface parameter). Longer time spans of data that become available in the future, along with improved data handling techniques will improve the current MSS models. Care must be given to
