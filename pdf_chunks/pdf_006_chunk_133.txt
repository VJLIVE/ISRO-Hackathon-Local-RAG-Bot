boreal forests than in adjacent areas (Foster et al., 1991). Though the boreal forests are always snow covered in the winter, within dense forests, snow that falls onto the ground through the canopy may not be visible from above. Some snow stays in the tree canopy and may thus be visible, but the snow often does not stay in the canopy during the entire winter. Snow in trees often sublimates before falling to the ground. Therefore, NDSI values will be appropriately modified to identify snow under forest cover. 6.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow cover Mapping It is recognized that NDSI will perform better in some land covers than in others. Specifically, results using the NDSI algorithm with AWiFS data above snow line show 100 percent snow cover when they were known by field measurements to be 100 percent snow covered. In forested areas, errors may be much larger. An estimate of the errors inherent in using Snow cover map in different land covers will be made using data from focused field missions, for example: agricultural (e.g. in the Kullu district.), forest free (e.g. Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh), forest (e.g. Forested region of Beas basin), Errors have been determined for the following land covers: forests, mixed agriculture and forest, barren/sparsely-vegetated, shrub land, wetlands, and glacial region. These land covers were selected because they cover a wide range of conditions encountered in snow covered parts of the Himalaya.
