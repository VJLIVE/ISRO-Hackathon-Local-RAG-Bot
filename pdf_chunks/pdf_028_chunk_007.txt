2.2.1 Overview and Background: Measurement of Rain by Space-Based Methods: VIS/IR Measurements of Rain : Digital image data from polar orbiting and geostationary meteorological satellites with synoptic coverage and quasi-continuous sampling in time have now become the major tools for attempts to monitor rainfall from space. The most common and easily exploited image data - cloud images in the visible and thermal IR bands - provide reasonably direct information on cloud areal extent, cloud type and cloud growth and decay. However, cloud formation to rainfall is an involved process. The Visible/IR sensing from space does not permit direct measurement of raindrops and hence provides essentially indirect inferences from which useful estimates of rain falling below the cloud may be derived. Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 9 Encouraged by the overpowering advantages of spacebased observations, even these proxy indicators have been exploited to severe as a basis for development of a variety of techniques for estimation of rainfall. The basic assumption that underlies all rainfall estimation techniques which utilize satellite images in the Visible and IR band is that raining clouds can be distinguished from non-raining ones : the former are usually thick and tall producing high visible band reflectance and cold cloud top temperatures. The possible physical basis for this lies mainly in the fact that cold high clouds represent signatures of upward motion in a locally saturated atmosphere indicating deep convection. The available schemes use visible and/or IR imagery and time evolution of cloud characteristics e.g. merging of cumulus clouds, cloud bands, anvils etc. seen in hourly/half hourly images. Many of these schemes are interactive in nature. Over the Indian region, monthly average rainfll information in the form of quantitative precipitation estimate (QPEs) maps with spatial resolution of 2.50x2.50 are produced on a regular basis since 1986 using INSAT-VHRR IR
