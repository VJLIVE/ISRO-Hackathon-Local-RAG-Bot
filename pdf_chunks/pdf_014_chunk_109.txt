than Tmin. 3) Inversion test is applied on the difference of maximum Ch#8 Tb (11µm) and maximum Ch#18 Tb (3.8 µm) within FOR. This test is applicable only during night time. For this test a threshold (Th1) is calculated using an empirical relation using the NET value of Ch#8 and Ch#18. Difference between the warmest pixel of Ch#18 and the warmest pixel of Ch#8 must be greater than the Th1 for a pixel to be clear. If any of these tests fail, then the whole box is assumed to be cloudy and not processed further, otherwise it will proceed for secondary array flag (SAF) procedure. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 95 (c). Secondary Array Flag (SAF): The first step of SAF is to compute skin temperature empirically using three channels, Ch#8 (Tb8), Ch#7 (Tb7) and Ch#18 (Tb18) and two channels Ch#8 (11µm) and Ch#7 (12µm). These empirical relations for skin temperature are as follows: TS3 = a0 + a1*Tb8 + a2* Tb7 + a3* Tb18 (using 3 channels) TS2 = b0 + b1* Tb8 + a2* Tb7 (using 2 channels) These coefficients are pre-determined from a large simulated matchup dataset. The standard tests for SAF are following:  The difference between TS3 and TS2 must not be greater than 2K.  The “cold sea test” only over ocean and this test fail if the highest Tb8 in FOR FOV is less than 270K.  The “reflected sunglint test” checks the difference between brightness temperatures for the highest Tb8 and Tb18. The difference must be less than 10K. If any of these SAF test is fail then the whole FOR is assigned as cloudy. Otherwise clear flag is assigned to whole FOR. SAF is followed by final and Individual FOV Flag (IFF). In IFF series of tests are applied to
