produce little or no rainfall. Under this assumption, cloud growth correction factor is applied to discriminate rain/no-rain situation. The correction factor is 0 when the cloud is becoming warmer and as 1 when the cloud is becoming colder. 15.4.1.4 Case Study Figure 5 shows the spatial comparison of rainfall estimates based on present IMSRA and after correction with TRMM-3B42 on 15 July 2014. The comparison suggests that the over estimation tendencies of IMSRA algorithm has reduced considerably by the correction scheme: central Indian region and the Bay of Bengal region shows the improvement in the improved version. Orographic regions also show significant improvement by the application of IMSRA correction scheme and the inherent under estimation tendencies have reduced in corrected version of IMSRA.

The results are presented in figure 6. The density plots suggest that operational IMSRA has in general over estimation tendency with respect to TRMM-3B42, which is improved by the correction. The statistics of the same is given in table -1. Comparison suggest that correlation has improved from 0.64 to 0.67 and rmse has reduced from 0.46 mm h-1 to 0.36 mm h- 1. The statistical comparison over the orographic region is shown in table-2 the correlation has improved from 0.53 to 0.68 and rmse has reduced from 1.01 mm h-1 to 0.87 mm h-1.
