dynamic multispectral thresholding contextual algorithm that is based on the sensitivity of the 3.9 μm (MIR channel) to high temperature sub-pixel anomalies relative to the less sensitive 10.8 μm (TIR-1 Channel). The current operational version of the INSAT fire product provides information on the location of the fire pixel only. In order to characterize the fire in terms of BBEP further details like estimates of instantaneous sub-pixel fire size, temperature, and radiative power; ecosystem type; and a classification flag needs to be worked out at pixel level. The fire properties are coupled to each other, one cannot calculate an instantaneous fire size without estimating a fire temperature, and fire radiative power (FRP) is a function of size and temperature. The algorithm will work upon accurate estimation of satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) for individual fire pixels. The INSAT-3D/3DR satellites observe wildfires at an interval of 15–30 min. Because of the impacts from sensor saturation, thin cloud cover, and background surface, the FRP values will not be continuously observed. The missing observations will be simulated by combining the available instantaneous FRP observations within a day and a set of representative climatological diurnal patterns of FRP for various ecosystems (evergreen forests, semi-evergreen and deciduous forests with their densities like dense, medium and open forests). Finally, the simulated diurnal variation in FRP will be applied to quantify biomass combustion and emissions in individual fire pixels with a latency of 1 day (0300 UTC – 0230 UTC for INSAt-3D & 0315 UTC to 0245 UTC for 3DR; following day). It is expected that near-real-time hourly emissions from BBEP would provide a crucial component for atmospheric and chemical transport modelers to forecast air quality and weather conditions.
