day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D/3DR data products scheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 columns for Asia Mercator sector product. 4.2.3.2. Required inputs Operational all-sky hourly Net radiation product, sliding monthly noon-time composite of land surface albedo, instantaneous LST from INSAT 3DR The proposed algorithm for ET will use the INSAT Net radiation hourly product in the MMDRPS operational chain. The net radiation will be computed from daily insolation product at 4 km from INSAT 3D/3DR, proposed operational albedo product from INSAT 3D/3DR, hourly forecast air temperature and relative humidity from WRF model, land surface temperature (LST) from INSAT 3D/3DR, using the surface emissivity obtained from 10 year historical MODIS database or real- time composite NDVI at 1-4 km from other sources (https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/ Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Meteosat) for SEVIRI NDVI product for Indian ocean coverage, INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 49 National Data Centre, NRSC, Hyderabad for OCM-2 & AWiFS NDVI). The net radiation needs to be made operationally available under clear and cloudy sky conditions to generate latent heat flux and Evapotranspiration (ET). 4.2.3.3. Hourly short-range forecast from WRF Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation model with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2
