The sensor transmits signals at regular interval and receives energy back scattered by the targets on the Earth. The DPGS generates Level 1B product from the sensor data. The Level 1B product carries back scattering coefficient (or sigma0) and other radiometric parameters along with geolocation information. The Level 4 products are generated from Level 1B products. This document describes format of Level 4 products of SCATSAT1 (operational version 1.0). These are high resolution products and are generated using Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (or SIR) technique. Currently, three parameters are given as a product: sigma0, gamma0 and brightness temperature. Depending on geo location extent, various categories of a product are defined. Depending on combinations of polarization/pass/look and temporal extent of data, various sub-categories of Level 4 products are defined. For a product (say, of sigma0, gamma0 or brightness temperature), the categories are described in Table 1
