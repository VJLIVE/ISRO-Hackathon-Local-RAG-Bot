K The sensitivity of the geophysical parameters to observing frequency is studied by Wilheit and Chang (1980). The study indicates high sensitivity for SST only at frequencies < 10 GHz. Hence the SST retrieval from MADRAS is not included in this document. The wind has high senstivity at 19 and 37 GHz channels but these channels are also affected by water vapor and cloud liquid water in the atmosphere. Gohil et al. (2000a) have shown that inclusion of lower frequency channels (6 GHz) in the wind retrieval algorithm improves the accuracy. This is mainly due to less influence of the water vapor and cloud liquid water on the lower frequency channels. Due to the absence of 10 and 6 GHz channels on MADRAS, wind retrieval accuracy will be slightly poorer compared to MSMR or TMI. The rms accuracies given in Table 3 come from SSM/I experience. We are hopeful that the retrieval accuracies for IWV, WS, and CLW will be almost similar to that available from SSM/I due to nearly identical lower frequency channels which are used for retrieval of the parameters being discussed in this document. However, the radiometer noise is crucial to achieve this accuracy.
