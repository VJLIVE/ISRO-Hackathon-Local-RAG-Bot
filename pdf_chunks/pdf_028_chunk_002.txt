emitted by the Earth-Atmosphere System in the visible, infrared and microwave spectrum through its four sensors onboard namely, MADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures), SAPHIR (Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropical par Radiométrie), ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation Budget) and ROSA (Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere). The MADRAS system is a five-channel (18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, 89 GHz and 157 GHz), dual polarized (except 23.8 GHz), self-calibrating, microwave radiometer system with azimuth scanning of 65 yielding data swath of 1700 kms at local incidence angle of 53.5 at the Earth’s surface. The SAPHIR sensor is a microwave humidity sounder operating around 183.31 GHz with six-channels (±0.2, ±1.1, ±2.8, ±4.2, ±6.8 and ±11 GHz) with cross-track scanning of 43 yielding data swath of 1705 Km with variable local incidence angle at the Earth’s surface. The ScaRaB sensor operates in four bands (0.55-0.65 m, 0.2-4.0 m, 0.2-50.0 m and 10.5-12.5 m) with a swath of 2242 km with cross-track scanning of  48.9. ROSA tracks the dual-frequency L- band signals, transmitted by the GPS-GNSS, in both the fore and aft direction from limb sounding geometry giving 1-dimensional (vertical) profile of geophysical parameters at various geo-locations of the earth. The major task is the retrieval of various geophysical parameters from MT sensors involving complexities of the inverse problem and the characteristics of the instruments. This draft document describes the theoretical basis of the algorithms for retrieving various geophysical parameters from these sensors. These algorithms are planned for the implementation on the operational basis for geophysical data product generation from MT satellite data. Algorithms for each sensor are provided in separate sections as presented in this document. Section 2 describes the details of rainfall retrieval from MADRAS which includes the state of the art of algorithms for retrieving rainfall
