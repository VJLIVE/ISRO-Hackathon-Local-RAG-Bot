only rain can significantly alter the altimeter measurement but also dense cloud, that is why we prefer using “trailing edge variation effect” instead of “rain effect”. A new “trailing edge variation flag” based on the analysis of the along-track variation of the off- nadir angle estimate (the so-called “Matching Pursuit” algorithm) has been defined and tested using Jason-1 data (Tournadre et al., 2009) and will be used operationally to detect the data potentially affected by atmospheric liquid water. This new approach to altimeter data rain flagging has to be validated and calibrated during the commissioning phase. 5.7.3. Limitations Please note that the trailing_edge_variation_flag parameter should be used carefully. In fact, as mentioned above, this flag detects surfaces changes caused by rain, sigma-blooms, cloud, etc. The meaning of the flag is: non short scale variation/short scale variation. To be considered only as a rain flag users should correlate this flag with water vapor content or liquid water content (see rad_water_vapor and rad_liquid_water parameter). These auxiliary information come from the radiometer measurements. Thresholds for these auxiliary parameters should be defined and provided during commissioning phase. 5.8. Ice Flag The range measurement from the altimeter is likely to have larger errors when the pulse is reflected off ice surfaces. The ice surface is not at sea level, but at some unknown distance above it. For this reason the SARAL/ALTIKA (O)(I)GDR provides an ice flag (see ice_flag parameter) to indicate when the data point is likely to be over ice. The ice flag is set if the absolute value of the difference between the model wet tropospheric correction and the dual frequency wet tropospheric correction retrieved from 23.8 GHz and 37.0 GHz brightness temperatures exceeds a specified threshold, OR if the number of valid 40-Hz altimeter range of the processed measurement is smaller than
