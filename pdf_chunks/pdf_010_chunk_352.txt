(3) the solar radiation during daytime. In the absence of atmosphere, estimation of LST of the Earth’s surface would be much simpler task. On the other hand, the presence of Earth’s atmosphere between the satellite and the surface changes the surface emitted radiances measured by the satellite sensor in several ways, making LST retrieval from satellite based platform a complex task (Dash et al. 2002). The transmission of the surface emitted radiance through the atmosphere to the satellite, and its interaction with the active elements of the atmosphere is expressed as Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) (Dash et al. 2002). Where, Land surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 286 = the radiance measured by the satellite based sensor (W/m2.sr.µm), = the at-sensor brightness temperature (K) = the surface emissivity = Planck radiance at surface temperature = atmospheric transmittance = upwelling path radiance = downwelling sky radiance at Earth’s surface The first term stands for the surface-emitted radiance after being attenuated by the atmosphere, second term corresponds to the upwelling sky radiance emitted by the atmosphere towards the sensor, and last term represents the downwelling radiation reaching the sensor after being reflected from the Earth’s surface. Here all the quantities refer to a spectral integration over the bandwidth of channel i and depend on the view zenith angle. The Planck radiance Bi(Ts) is expressed as,           1 . ) ( 2 5 1 s iT c i s i e c T B   (2) with c1 and c2 being the Planck’s radiation constants, with values of 1.19104.108 W.m4.m-2.sr-1 and 14387.7 m.K, respectively. Inverting Eq. (1) we get, In this problem, the surface temperature is basically coupled with two factors: the surface emissivity and the atmospheric absorptions. Developing an LST algorithm
