empirical value [Wunsch, 1972] of the IB response at mid latitudes. Some researchers use other values. Note that the surface atmospheric pressure is also proportional to the dry tropospheric correction, and so the parameter inv_bar_corr approximately changes by 4 to 5 mm as model_dry_tropo_corr changes by 1 mm (assuming a constant mean global surface pressure). The uncertainty of the ECMWF atmospheric pressure products is somewhat dependent on location. Typical errors vary from 1 mbar in the northern Atlantic Ocean to a few SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 59 mbars in the southern Pacific Ocean. A 1-mbar error in pressure translates into a 10 mm error in the computation of the IB effect. Note that the time varying mean global pressure over the oceans, P, during the first eight years of the T/P mission had a mean value of approximately 1010.9 mbar, with an annual variation around this mean of approximately 0.6 mbar. However, the T/P data products provided a static inverse barometer correction referenced to a constant mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar. IB(T/P) = 1013.3) - (P -9.948 atm âˆ— Sea surface heights that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced to a mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar are therefore approximately -9.948*(1010.9-1013.3) = 23.9 mm lower than those that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced to a time varying global mean pressure, and the difference between the two sea surface heights has an annual variation of approximately 9.948*0.6 = 6 mm. 5.10.2. Barotropic/Baroclinic Response to Atmospheric Forcing The High Frequency Wind and Pressure Response correction, hf_fluctuations_corr, complements the Inverted Barometer (IB) correction. Like both tides and IB, the ocean response to wind and pressure (after removing the IB part) has energy at periods higher than the 20 day implied
