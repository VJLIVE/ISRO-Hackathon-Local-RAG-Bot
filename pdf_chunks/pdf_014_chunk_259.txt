ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS would definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates from integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables. (ii) Scale mismatch Spatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel area while the average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale mismatch puts constrain in validation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with INSAT 3D. INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 226 (iii) Difference in time sampling For spatial ETo, daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at instantaneous snapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-hourly averages from AMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets (iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging The product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of approximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ETo estimates have higher errors during the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud dynamics such as Diglipur (A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc. (v) Quality of WRF forecast An initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-2Â°C, RH of 5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. The inherent errors in first three variables will have implications on the overall error budget. 17.9. Future scope of improvement Recent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT 3D insolation algorithm using additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. Much of the uncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully be improved. Recent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed improvement in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of real-time satellite
