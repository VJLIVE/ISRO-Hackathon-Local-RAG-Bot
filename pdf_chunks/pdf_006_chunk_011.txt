and ice). 2.4.1.2 Infrared Brightness Temperature Thresholds and Difference (BTD) Tests The azimuthally averaged form of the infrared radiative transfer equation is given by (1) In addition to atmospheric structure, which determines B(T), the parameters describing the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere are the single scattering albedo, ω0 = σsca/σext, which ranges between 1 for a non-absorbing medium and 0 for a medium that absorbs and does not scatter energy, the optical depth, δ, and the Phase function, P(µ, µ′), which describes the direction of the scattered energy. To gain insight on the issue of detecting clouds using IR observations from satellites, it is useful to first consider the two-stream solution . Using the discrete-ordinates approach (Liou 1973; Stamnes and Swanson 1981), the solution for the upward radiance from the top of a uniform single cloud layer is: Iobs = M–L–exp(–kδ) + M+L+ + B(Tc), (2) where I↓ is the downward radiance (assumed isotropic) incident on the top of the cloud layer, I↑ the upward radiance at the base of the layer, and g the asymmetry parameter. Tc is a representative temperature of the cloud layer. Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 19 A challenge in cloud masking is detecting thin clouds. Assuming a thin cloud layer, the effective transmittance (ratio of the radiance exiting the layer to that incident on the base) is derived from equation (2) by expanding the exponential. The effective transmittance is a function of the ratio of I↓/I↑ and B(Tc)/I↑. Using atmospheric window regions for cloud detection minimizes the I↓/I↑ term and maximizes the B(Tc)/I↑ term. Figure 3 is a simulation of differences in brightness temperature between clear and cloudy sky conditions using the simplified set of equations . In these simulations, there is no atmosphere, the surface is emitting at a blackbody
