centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). It is defined as             n i t t n i s t I I I I E 1 2 1 2 1 (4) Where tI and sI are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and tI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is normalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 implies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a
