processed wind field of that scene is converged. At this stage, the resulting wind field mostly resembles the true wind field in that scene. It is important to note that the retrieval of ambiguity filtered wind vector field is mainly dependent on the amount of noise present in radar backscatter data as well as on its spatial distribution. 5.2.1 Algorithm for localized directional ambiguity removal: In case when the scatterometer data is highly noisy over certain parts of the swath, the resulting wind field still may have localized ambiguities, which may not always be possible to be removed by the filtering process alone. Highly localized ambiguities may still be removed using a filtering process over coarser spatial resolution data prepared from the given data. In this method, the filtered wind field with localized ambiguities is further divided into small segments. Medians of the same ranking solutions for these coarser resolution data are obtained. The median solutions for these segments are further processed for ambiguity filtering as mentioned above. Based on filtered median wind field, the original ambiguity filtered wind field with localized ambiguity is corrected to yield final filtered wind field (Gohil and Pandey, 1994). 5.2.2 Directional ambiguity removal over inner beam swath: The directional ambiguity removal over the inner beam swath may be performed in a usual manner as described above by first ignoring the wind solutions exactly over the sub-satellite track. Wind solutions over a very narrow region around sub-satellite track being very erroneous are firstly required to be ignored because of the retrieval skill halved 25 due to the symmetry of the measurement geometry and the pairing of solutions as mentioned in earlier sections. Subsequent to the ambiguity filtering in rest of the inner beam swath, wind solutions over the sub-satellite track should then be considered and
