Singh Smoke Identification Baseline Document 9.2 Introduction In this document, we offer some background to the smoke identification problem, list the INSAT-3D instrument characteristics, describe the theoretical basis of the smoke identification algorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm implementation, and outline the planned validation approach, the technical issues and the future scope. 9.2.1 Overview and Background Smoke is a form of particulate matter, which contains liquid or solid particles of the size ranging from 1−200µm. It is formed by combustion or other chemical processes. Each year more than 100 million tons of smoke aerosols are released into the atmosphere as
