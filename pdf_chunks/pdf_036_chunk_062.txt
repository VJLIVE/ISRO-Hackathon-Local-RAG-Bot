JGP95E database [Chapter 2 of Lemoine et al., 1998]. The bathymetric information in DTM2000.1 (originating from Smith and Sandwell's [1994] global sea floor topography) has significant differences with the ETOPO5 bathymetric model. The mean and standard deviation of these differences is 10 m and 270 m, respectively. 3.2.6. Ocean Tides The two geocentric tide values provided on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR, ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2, are computed with diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tide values predicted by the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, respectively. Both geocentric ocean tide fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include the load tides from the respective models (load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2), and the equilibrium long-period ocean tide (ocean_tide_equil). These two fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include the S1 oceanic response to atmospheric pressure based on the model from Ray and Egbert (2004). The FES2004 model also includes the M4 ocean tide. Note that the load tide fields (load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2) only include the load tides from the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, and do not contain the load tides from the S1, M4, or equilibrium long-period ocean tides. Both models are interpolated to provide the geocentric ocean and load tides at the location of the altimeter measurement, and an interpolation quality flag is provided on the (O)(I)GDRs to indicate the quality of this interpolation (see interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol1 and interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol2).

GOT4.8 Ocean Tide Model Solution GOT4.8 [Ray 1999; Ray, personnal communication], is the last version of GOT models developped by R. Ray. This model is identical to 4.7 in all constituents save S2. GOT4.7 used the following data: • 364 cycles of T/P • 114 cycles of T/P on the interlaced orbit • 117 cycles of ERS1 and ERS2 • 126 cycles of GFO None Jason data has been
