of the performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag), detritus (ad) absorption coefficients and their integrated response at 443nm, have been illustrated in Table 3. The important point here is to note that the mean values of NASA bio optical marine algorithm datasets [NOMAD] for absorption due to CDOM, detritus and their integrated response are 0.18 (m−1), 0.06 (m−1) and 0.24 (m−1) respectively. LMB and GSM derived integrated responses are 0.21 (m−1) as compared to NOMAD i.e. 0.24 (m−1) while New model derived response is very close to NOMAD i.e. 0.23 (m−1). Further, new model derived individual response i.e. absorption due to CDOM and detritus 0.17 (m−1) and 0.06 (m−1) respectively are very close to the mean values of NOMAD. Similarly, Gupta et al (2020) also works very well for CDOM showing close proximity to NO- MAD mean CDOM at 443nm. The integrated response ad+ag at 443nm is slightly underestimated with respect to NOMAD in-situ data while other two models like GSM and Lee-Morel-Bricaud are overestimated with respect to NOMAD in-situ data as shown in Figure (6). Also, bio-optical model [22] derived only cdom (ag) at 443nm with slope tending to unity and R-square and RMSE, 0.82 and 0.10, respectively. Whereas, the new parameterized model derived cdom and detritus coefficients at 443nm, are much underestimated with respect to NOMAD ag and ad at 443nm while their integrated response at 443nm is slightly better than their individual ones. The approach adopted in the current model for the isolation of detritus and CDOM absorption coefficient from remote sensing reflectance is novel and can be used globally. Still, there is even much more scope for their further improvements as well.
