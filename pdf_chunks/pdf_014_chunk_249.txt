humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration process during winter. This trend changes during March and October. From April to September, ET0 is mostly sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in July). From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature and their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of ET0 variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to other variables’ variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during summer, and wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B). In Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation to climate input variables using P-M method in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a major impact on INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 214 ET0 calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most influent variable during summer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the great sensitivity of this Penman– Monteith formula to solar radiation during summer period, when ET0 reaches its highest values, and when its calculation is critical for irrigation process and ecological modelling. These results were obtained for Mediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work published by Gong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to similar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET0 during winter than it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to ET0 calculation. Figure 4.
