using an elliptical weighting function (Mahesh et al., 2014). The global bias correction is designed on the basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). The average bias between the rain estimates of TRMM-3B42 and IMSRA rain is absorbed into a polynomial model. Orographic correction is computed on the basis of a climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and TRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions. It is applied as a symmetrically reducing elliptical weighting function of the form W= (A2 - S2) / (A2 + S2 â€“ 2LF2) A= d1 + d2 where d1 and d2 are the distances from the end points of a line with two foci as the ends and A is the length of semi major axis. LF is the distance between two foci. S is the sum of Euclidean distance calculated for every point from the two foci. The graphical representation of the function is given in figure 4.

(1998) and Mahesh et al. (2014). It was observed that expanding clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming colder increases the rainfall rates and decaying clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. Under this assumption, cloud growth correction factor is applied to discriminate rain/no-rain situation. The correction factor is 0 when the cloud is becoming warmer and as 1 when the cloud is becoming colder. 15.4.1.4 Case Study Figure 5 shows the spatial comparison of rainfall estimates
