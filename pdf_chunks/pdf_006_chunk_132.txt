3D snow maps with AWiFS and MODIS operational snow maps INSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by AWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap results with these independently-produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified that will permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one another. There are several hemispheric-scale satellite-derived snow-cover maps available, but none has been fully validated. 6.6.1.2. Mapping Snow in Densely-Forested Areas A significant limitation in mapping the extent of snow cover occurs in situations of mixed pixels where snow cover is obscured by dense forest cover. The snow covered forested landscape is actually never completely snow covered because the tree branches, trunks and canopies often do not get or stay snow covered. Often, in boreal forests, snow that falls on the coniferous tree canopy will not stay on the canopy for the entire winter due to sublimation. Thus, even in a continuously snow covered area, much of the forested landscape will not be snow covered. It may be very difficult, even with field measurements and high- resolution air photos, to determine what percentage of the area is snow covered. Additionally, when viewing at off-nadir angles the tree branches, canopies, etc., will obscure even more of the snow than when viewing at near-nadir angles. Dense forests cover much of the Earthâ€™s land surface. Snow accumulates to greater depths and melts later in the spring in the boreal forests than in adjacent areas (Foster et al., 1991). Though the boreal forests are always snow covered in the winter, within dense forests, snow that falls onto the ground through the canopy may not be visible from above. Some snow stays in the tree canopy and may thus be
