a body Tb, which is related to its physical temperature T by following equation: Tb =  T where,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a white body; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body. The IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a atmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, measured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those surfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated by effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will be referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be measured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be unity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called `brightness temperature’. Only when  = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body temperature. The value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of lapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with height, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be infrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this context, because  < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). The more serious problem is distinguishing between cold
