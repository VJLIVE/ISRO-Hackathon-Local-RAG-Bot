following reasons:  Sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS, have been used for generating the snow products using similar algorithm. (Hall et al., 1995; Kulkarni et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2013; Rathore et al., 2015).  The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar illumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2006).  INSAT 3D(R) Met payloads has a channel in 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial resolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number INSAT 3D(R) 1&2 channels are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km resolution.  SWIR reflectance/Brightness temperature will be used to identify certain type of clouds which were not separated using NDSI threshold. Threshold values will be fine-tuned. This will be initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of Space Applications Centre and then sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D(R) data.  AWiFS derived snow cover products will be used to estimate snow part in synchronous INSAT pixel to develop approach for estimating fractional snow cover product for INSAT data. It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the product is generated. Snow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from many other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A similar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been proven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year (Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished using the NDSI. Other promising techniques, such as
