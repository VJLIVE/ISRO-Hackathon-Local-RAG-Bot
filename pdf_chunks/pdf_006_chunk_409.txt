It is composed of direct and diffuse components. While reaching the ground from top-of-atmosphere solar radiation is attenuated by different atmospheric constituents such as water vapour, ozone, aerosol, air molecule, clouds and fogs through scattering and absorption processes. The molecular scattering by air molecules is known as Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering is Mie scattering. The component of solar radiation that reaches earth surface without deviation from original direction is known as direct or beam insolation. The component of solar radiation reaching earth surface after scattering is known as diffuse insolation. Diffuse component is composed of three components such as : Rayleigh scattered, aerosol scattered and reflected multiple scattered insolation. Clouds play major role in attenuating solar radiation while reaching earth surface. It is accountable for 70% depletion of solar radiation depending on its type, distribution and ice-cloud proportioning of three- dimensional vertical structure. Moreover, aerosol acts as cloud condensation nucleii (CCN). The contribution of clouds towards diurnal variability of insolation is more than aerosol
