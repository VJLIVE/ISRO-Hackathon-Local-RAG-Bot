Aerosols have largescale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (IPCC 2007; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is also critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi- spectral satellite sensors and military operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to carbon dioxide greenhouse effects, but with opposite signs and larger
