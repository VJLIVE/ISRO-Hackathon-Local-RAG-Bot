either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be infrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this context, because  < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). The more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick but are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds which extend into lower troposphere. Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 53 4.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI: 4.4.1.1.3 Operational Implementation Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT The INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, …., 2100 UTC, i.e., every three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 8 x 8 km in case of KALPANA and INSAT-3A and 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, so that several pixels fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of each pixel in a given image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be calculated from a look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be ignored while within it are assigned to appropriate box. Step 2: Histogram Generation: After the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed to generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) INSAT IR Data 3 Hourly Image Conversion from Grey Count to TBs Look Up Table for Calibration Detection of Deep Convective Clouds Fractional Rain Cloud Coverage Estimation of Rainfall Generation of 24 Classes Histogram, mean & variance Estimation of daily Rainfall (8 images) Estimation of Monthly Rainfall Estimation of Seasonal Rainfall Rainfall Validation (DWR/SFRG) Sea surface temperature INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 54 images for 1.0 x 1.0
