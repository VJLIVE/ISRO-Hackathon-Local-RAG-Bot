orographic correction is carried out by determining by gradient of the elevations in the direction of the prevailing 850 mb level winds (Vicente et al., 2002). 3.0 Sample Results and comparisons The H-E method which is currently operational at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) uses INSAT-3D Imager thermal infrared (TIR) observations at 10.7 Âµm along with environmental parameters taken from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to make a quantitative assessment of the precipitation. The H-E technique provides rain rate at each pixel with every acquisition of the satellite data (presently, 4x4 km2 and 30 minutes for INSAT-3D). The procedure and coefficients are adopted from H-E method developed by NOAA/STAR. Hydro-Estimator performed reasonably well over the land and oceans. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the instantaneous H-E rain on 23 September 2013 at 1200 UTC from INSAT-3D along with H-E rain as derived by NOAA using Meteosat and rain from TRMM 3B41RT. There is a good qualitative agreement between rain rates derived using INSAT-3D and Meteosat. Though H-E rain by NOAA and by us uses the same SAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 7 technique and coefficients, the difference between the two methods still exists due to their different inputs. While INSAT-3D based H-E algorithm used 0.5ox0.5o gridded 6 hourly NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) model derived parameters whereas NOAA algorithm uses high-resolution ETA model derived fields. Nevertheless, there is good qualitative agreement between H-E rain derived from INSAT-3D and Meteosat. There is also fairly good qualitative agreement between H-E rain from INSAT-3D and from 3B41RT. The 3B41RT is microwave based hourly rain rates. Fig.1: Rain rate in (mm/h) on 23 Sep. 2013 at 1200 UTC from (a) INSAT-3D by SAC, (b) GMS by NOAA and (c) TRMM 3B41RT. Despite of having good agreement over most of the regions, the
