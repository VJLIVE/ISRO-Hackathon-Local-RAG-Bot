Profiling) Algorithm. These are most reliable microwave satellite rainfall estimates for calibrating the thermal IR radiances to estimate rainfall. A large data base of collocated INSAT-3D â€“ IR Radiances along with TRMM/SSMI rainfall rates will be generated over land and oceanic regions. The retrieval of rainfall thus, would be carried out using this data base using multiple regression approach. The coefficients for land and oceanic regions will be derived separately. Over land regions the further classification would be possible only after extensive validations. The calibration with microwave derived rain will be dynamically updated in case there are changes in the rainfall products itself. Step 4. Moisture Availability and Sub-cloud Adjustments: A moisture correction factor is to be used to adjust for the tendency of the overestimation of precipitation in wet regions and underestimate in dry regions (Vicente et al. 1998). This correction factor, as first proposed by Scofield (1987) consisted of the precipitable water (PW, in inches) and relative humidity (RH, expressed as a decimal fraction) from the 500 hPa to surface layer of the IMD model. The functional form of rainfall and IR brightness temperature relationship would be further developed under different moisture conditions. The relationship is adjusted by moisture factor, which is designed to modulate the evaporation effects on rain below cloud base for different moisture environments. The amount of moisture factor will also determine the growth factor along with the successive image data. Thus the final rainfall equations will be different for different RH and PW amounts so that the real time PW and RH data can be ingested properly with a priori knowledge well established for the region of study/operation. Step 5: Calibration and validation and Fine Tuning of algorithm: Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations in
