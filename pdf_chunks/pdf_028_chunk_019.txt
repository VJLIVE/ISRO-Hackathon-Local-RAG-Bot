into many layers and assume that all microphysical properties (e.g., particle concentration, liquid/ice water content, etc.) are uniform within each layer, but temperature varies linearly with optical depth. By solving the Ljs the radiances at quadrature angles (i) are obtained. A boundary condition at the surface allows us to calculate the upward radiation at surface given the surface emissivity and temperature. Using this analogy of calculating downward radiation from top layer to surface, upward radiance can be can continuously calculated from the bottom of the layer to the top of the layer and letting  = 0 until the radiance at the top of the layer is solved. The satellite observed radiance at the top of the atmosphere is then obtained. Brightness temperature can be calculated from the radiance using Plank’s function. Horizontally and Vertically polarized radiances are calculated separately because of the difference of their surface emissivity.

Three components of the troposphere are important absorbers. Water vapor, liquid water and molecular Oxygen. Frequencies where absorption due to molecular Oxygen is important (roughly 50 to 70 GHz and near 119 GHz) are used for temperature sounding but are not often used for rainfall sensing. For our purposes, the absorption due to molecular Oxygen is a minor correction needed to be quantitatively correct but not necessary for conceptual understanding. 2.5.3 Algorithm Description: Based on the above brief presentation of the formulation of both emission and scattering based radiative transfer, it is highly desirable to create a data based
