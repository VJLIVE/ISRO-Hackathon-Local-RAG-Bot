to produce OGDR products. In near real time, ISRO disseminates the complete set of OGDR files via ftp and EUMETSAT disseminates the complete set of OGDR files on EUMETCast. The complete set of OGDR files consists of OGDR and OGDR-SSHA. Details on data dissemination services from ISRO and EUMETSAT agencies are described below. 2.7.2. Access to off-line data The IGDR families are produced solely by CNES while GDR families are produced by CNES and ISRO. They are available for French and foreign users on the AVISO ftp server (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com). For Indian users, off line GDR products are available on MOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in/login.jsp). Both of these archival facilities also provide a variety of auxiliary files used to produce the O/I/GDR datasets, and ISRO also provides the OGDR family of datasets. Data dissemination services from ISRO and CNES agencies are described below. 2.7.3. Documentation and Sample Reader Software This SARAL/AltiKa User’s Handbook document describes only the native product format. A description of the O/I/GDR product format and contents is provided in the CNES document “SALP- ST-M-EA-15839-CN: SALP Products Specification - Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products” (see RD 4). All documents are available through the data dissemination services. Tools such as sample reading routines in Fortran-90, C, and IDL are also available through the data dissemination services on the AVISO website and on the ISRO website (TBC by ISRO). The toolbox BRAT is also recommended to read and study AltiKa data (see 6.4.3). 2.8. Access to data via ISRO 2.8.1. Access to NRT data TBD by ISRO 2.8.2.
