Coupled model chlorophyll, b) Analysed Chlorophyll, c) OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll, and d) Chlorophyll from multi satellites 3.7.2 Comparison with Bio-Argo data Independent validation of the analysed chlorophyll and merged chlorophyll from multi-satellites has been conducted using Bio-Argo measurements. Bio- Argo is an extension of the Argo program, incorporating biogeochemical observations, including chlorophyll-a concentration, oxygen concentration, pH, and more. These floats are deployed and managed by an international community in coordination with institutes from various countries (Wong et al., 2020). Bio-Argo floats are downloaded from htttps://biogeochmical- argo.org. Figure 10 shows the buoy locations used for the comparison. Multi-satellites chlorophyll, Analysed Chlorophyll, and model simulated chlorophyll without OCM-3 are compared with buoy measured chlorophyll and the statics are shown in the Table 1. Percentage error is computed using the equation 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝐻𝐿 𝐵𝑖𝑜−𝐴𝑟𝑔𝑜 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝐶𝐻𝐿 ∗100. RMSE is found less for the analysed chlorophyll compared to multi-satellite derived chlorophyll when compared against Bio-Argo data. One added advantage in the Analysed chlorophyll is the availability of data at all ocean points. Another reason is that collocated points are less in the case of multi- satellite data and is owing to the data void due to cloud obstruction. This issue does not affect analysed chlorophyll data as it is generated by combining chlorophyll observation with model simulation, providing chlorophyll at all model grid points. Additionally, analysed chlorophyll has the advantage of model simulations and observations and it’s the errors are less compared to other two individual components such as model simulations and observations. Analysed chlorophyll OCF data exhibits a positive bias of 0.24 mg/m3 and is partially attributed to the positive bias in OCM-3 chlorophyll observations. Among the three CHL datasets, analysed CHL shows a lower percentage error, indicating better performance. Figure 10. Bio-Argo buoy locations for the validation period. Table 1 :
