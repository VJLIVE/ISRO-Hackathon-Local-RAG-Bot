NetCdf format and CF convention The netCDF data format has been chosen to store the different data sets (one file per data set). This format is extremely flexible, self describing and has been adopted as a de-facto standard for many operational oceanography systems. What’s more, the files follow the Climate and Forecast NetCDF conventions CF-1.1 because these conventions provide a practical standard for storing. 6.1.2. The NetCDF Data Model A netCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which they are identified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and relations among data fields in an array-oriented data set. 6.1.2.1. Dimensions A dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for example, time, latitude, longitude, or height. A dimension might also be used to index other quantities (waveforms index for example). The following dimensions are used in the SARAL/AltiKa product files: Dimension Name Value SSHA Data Set GDR Data Set SGDR Data Set time Number of measurements in the file X X X meas_ind 40 (number of elementary measurements) X X wvf_ind 128 (number of waveform samples) X Table 15 - Dimensions used in the SARAL/AltiKa data sets 6.1.2.2. Variables Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of values of the same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a
