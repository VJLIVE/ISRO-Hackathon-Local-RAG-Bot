array for the 11 μm brightness temperatures centerd on the pixel of interest is computed. If the | Tmaxmean - Tmean | ≤ 2.0 and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 0. Over Land , If (Tmean - Tmaxmean ) ≤ –12.0 K and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 1. Over Ocean, If (Tmean - Tmaxmean ) ≤ –6.0 K and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel, cloud flag = 1. ADJACENT PIXEL TEST After all the above tests , for the remaining pixel, where cloudflag = 9, in the 3 x 3 array of the 11 μm brightness temperatures, find the number of cloudy (n1) and clear (n2) pixels. If n1 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 1 If n2 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 0 TEMPORAL UNIFORMITY TEST The remaining pixels with cloudflag 9 are compared with the pixels of previous hour image. If the difference in BT11 is less than 1K then it is assumed that the atmospheric condition over that pixel has not changed much from the previous hour and the cloudflag of that pixel from previous hour is carried over to the current data If | BT11 (current image) – BT11 (previous hour image) | ≤ 1 K then Cloudflag (current) = cloudflag (previous) . FINAL THRESHOLD TEST Cloud Mask INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 23 For remaining uncertain points (cloudflag = 9) final threshold test is done to assign probably clear or cloudy flag to each pixel. In this test Over land : If 2 < | BT11 – BTmax | ≤ 6 then cloudflag = 2 (probably clear) And if 6 < | BT11 – BTmax | ≤ 12 then cloudflag = 3
