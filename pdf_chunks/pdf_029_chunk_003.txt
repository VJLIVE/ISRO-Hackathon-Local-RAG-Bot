Indian landmass. The high spatial resolution of 700 meters makes this product unique among globally available aerosol products. Apart from these, it will open the door for the utilization of OCM-2 data for other land applications also. Since OCM-2 in local area coverage mode have 2-day repetivity, the temporal resolution of OCM-2 AOD is two days, with an exception for the overlap region where daily retrievals are possible. 3 Contents List Figures List of Tables List of Acronyms and Symbols 1.0 Algorithm Configuration Information 1.1 Algorithm Name 1.2 Algorithm Identifier 1.3 Algorithm Specification 2.0 Introduction 2.1 Overview and background 2.2 Objectives 3.0 Inputs 3.1 Static Data 3.2 Image and pre-processing data (Dynamic) 3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs 4.0 Algorithm Functional Specifications 4.1 Overview 4.2 Instrument Characteristics 4.3 Theoretical background 4.3.1 Gas absorption 4.3.2 Cloud and inland water masking 4.3.3 Physical basis and model for surface characterization 4.3.4 Radiative transfer calculations 4.3.5 Aerosol inversion 4.4 Flowchart 4.5 Operational Implementation 5.0 Outputs 5.1 Format of the output and the domain 6.0 Validation 6.1 Data required 6.2 Methods of validation 6.2.1 AERONET data for validation 6.2.2 Handheld sun photometer validation 6.2.3 Satellite-based Inter-comparisons 6.3 Provisional validation 6.3.1 Derived AOD maps 6.3.2 Validation results with AERONET data 7.0 Technical issues (Limitations etc.) 8.0 Future scope 9.0 Discussion 10.0 References 4 List of Figures Figure 1.
