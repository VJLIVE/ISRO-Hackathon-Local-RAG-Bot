is the fraction of FOV covered with cloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an "accurate" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 2, observed WV and IR radiances at each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different Water vapor wind INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 188 heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface and cloud conditions. Fig 2: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al., 1993) By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated radiances are systematically lower,
