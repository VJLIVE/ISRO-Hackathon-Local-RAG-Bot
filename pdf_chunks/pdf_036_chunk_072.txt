gradient, and Brenner and Koblinsky [1990] estimated it at about 2 cm/km over most of the ocean, larger over continental slopes, reaching 20 cm/km at trenches. Even if the passes repeated exactly, one would have to interpolate along the pass (say, to a fixed set of latitudes) because a 3 km mismatch in along pass position would cause approximately a 6 cm difference in the geoid, which would mistakenly be interpreted as a change in oceanographic conditions. Both problems are simultaneously solved if the quantity one interpolates along a given pass is the difference : Residual Height – Mean Sea Surface Then the real geoid changes across the track are automatically accounted for (to the extent the MSS model is close to the true geoid) because the MSS is spatially interpolated to the actual satellite latitude-longitude in the (O)(I)GDR. The residual height term above is the residual sea surface height after applying all the tidal, atmospheric and ionospheric corrections, etc. Otherwise, those need to be interpolated separately. One possible approach is to interpolate along track to a set of common points, a "reference" track. The reference could be: · An actual pass with maximum data and/or minimum gaps, or · A specially constructed fixed track (see below). The procedure is the following: · For each common point, find neighboring points in the pass of interest (POI). · In the POI, interpolate along track to the common point, using longitude as the independent variable, for each quantity of interest - sea surface height (see above), mean sea surface, geoid, tides, etc. · As stated above, the quantity to compare at each common point is : ΔSSH = Interpolated POI SSH - Interpolated POI MSS · Other geophysical corrections must be applied to ΔSSH, depending on the type of investigation The geoid
