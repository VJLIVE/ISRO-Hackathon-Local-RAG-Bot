error budget 2.4.2. Sampling Strategy As for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured along a fixed grid of subsatellite tracks such that it is possible to investigate and minimize the spatial and temporal aliases of surface geostrophic currents and to minimize the influence of the geoid on measurements of the time- varying topography.

Tidal Aliases As for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured such that tidal signals are not aliased into semiannual, annual, or zero frequencies (which influences the calculation of the permanent circulation) or frequencies close to these. 2.4.4. Duration and coverage Sea level shall be measured for a minimum of five years, with the potential to extend this period for an additional two years. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite shall overfly the reference ENVISAT ground tracks. 2.5. Mission Description SARAL/AltiKa will use an Earth orbiting satellite equipped with a radar altimeter and other instruments to directly measure sea-surface elevation along the fixed grid of sub-satellite ground tracks traced out by the ERS1/2 and ENVISAT satellites. In so doing, SARAL/AltiKa will continue the data collection started with ERS1/2 and followed by ENVISAT. The sea-surface height measurement must be made with an accuracy of 4.6 cm or better (at 1 Hz) in order to meet the mission objectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to fulfill the mission objectives and will be launched in 2012 to take over for ENVISAT mission. The ocean topography is obtained through three basic measurements: 1) the satellite range above the sea surface derived from the altimeter, 2) the tropospheric range delay measured by the radiometer to correct the altimeter range, 3) the altitude of the satellite above the reference ellipsoid derived from precise orbit determination.
