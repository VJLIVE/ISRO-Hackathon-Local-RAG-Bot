averaged values with corresponding H-E and WWR rain values. This is shown in Table 4 below.

The rms difference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of these similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, the correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, whereas that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high value of 0.93. Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H- E is also attempted and is shown in the Table 4. It may be recalled that 3B42 V7 is from state-of-art algorithm that combines IR and Microwave
