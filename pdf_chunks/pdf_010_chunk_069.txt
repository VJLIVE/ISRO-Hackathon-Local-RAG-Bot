Step 4: Calibration of IR brightness temperatures with the contemporary microwave radiometric measurements of rainfall (e.g. TRMM Rainfall from NASA’s GPROF algorithm). Step 5. The IMD model based forecast of precipitable water and relative humidity for correction of rainfall equation based on above calibration procedure to be made available from IMD on every 6 hourly interval. Step 6: Validation and fine tuning of the algorithm based on IMD’s DWR and AWS and fast response rain gauges on hourly basis. Step 7. Processing of the data for the different temporal scales (3, 6, 12 hours and etc.) based on the above steps of the development and validation of the algorithm. Remarks: Some of the steps like the cloud microphysics (cloud microphysics and their optical properties, etc.) are a grey area of research and needs experience and thus can be taken up only as R&D efforts.
