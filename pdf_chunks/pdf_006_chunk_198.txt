points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface and cloud conditions. Cloud motion vector INSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 169 Fig 1: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al., 1993) By extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. These steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances can be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. 2.3 Cloud Base Method (BASE): Wind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology
