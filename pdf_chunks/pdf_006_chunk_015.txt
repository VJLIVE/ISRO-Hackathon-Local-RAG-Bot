(3.9 μm) and in the longwave (11 μm) window regions (BT11 – BT3.9) can be used to detect partial cloud or thin cloud within the INSAT field of view. Small or negative differences are observed only for the case where an opaque scene (such as thick cloud or the surface) fills the field of view of the sensor. Negative differences occur at night over extended clouds due to the lower cloud emissivity at 3.9 μm. During the daylight hours the difference between BT11 and BT3.9 is large and negative because of reflection of solar energy at 3.9 μm. This technique is very successful at detecting low-level water clouds. Moderate to large differences between BT11 and BT3.9 result when a nonuniform scene (e.g., broken cloud) is observed. The different spectral response to a scene of non-uniform temperature is a result of Planck’s law. The brightness temperature dependence on the warmer portion of the scene increasing with decreasing wavelength (the shortwave window Planck radiance is proportional to temperature to the thirteenth power, while the longwave dependence is to the fourth power). Differences in the brightness temperatures of the longwave and shortwave channels are small when viewing mostly clear or mostly cloudy scenes; however, for intermediate situations the differences become large (greater than 3°C). Table 2 lists examples of the thresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. We have used similar thresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. The application of BT11 – BT3.9 is difficult in deserts during daytime. Bright desert regions with highly variable emissivities tend to be incorrectly classified as cloudy with this test. The problem is mitigated somewhat in the cloud mask by making use of a double-sided test where brightness temperature differences greater than a "low" threshold but less than a "high" threshold are labeled clear while values outside this
