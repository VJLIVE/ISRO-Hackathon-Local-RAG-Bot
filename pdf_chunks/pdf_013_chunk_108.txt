of passing the first step a series of tests are applied on the FOR in second step. In third and final step, a series of tests are applied on each FOV and the results of these tests decide the final outcome. (b). Primary Array Flag (PAF): This is first step of cloud detection to generate the primary array flag. Four tests are applied on a FOR to generate PAF. Generation of PAF requires computation of two thresholds Tmax and Tmin from ancillary information. Tmax and Tmin are computed using surface skin temperature information which is available either through AWS or from model forecast. Here model forecast is used for surface skin temperature. Tmax= TS + 20, and Tmin= TS - 20 Where, TS is the surface skin temperature. After this calculation the following checks are applied: 1) Visible reflectance of the warmest pixel in FOR computed from Ch#8 (11µm) must be less than a certain threshold value. The value of threshold for visible channel over land is 25% and over water is 7%. The value of threshold may vary for low surface temperature and low sun angles. If the surface skin temperature is less than 273K the threshold value over land is increased by a factor of 1.5. Similarly, to take care of low sun angles the land limit is multiplied by solar zenith angle. This test is possible only for day time. 2) The Ch#8 Tb (11µm) of warmest pixel must be less than Tmax and must be greater than Tmin. 3) Inversion test is applied on the difference of maximum Ch#8 Tb (11µm) and maximum Ch#18 Tb (3.8 µm) within FOR. This test is applicable only during night time. For this test a threshold (Th1) is calculated using an empirical relation using the NET value of Ch#8 and
